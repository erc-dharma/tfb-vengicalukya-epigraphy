                    <p>Halantas. Final T in l19 is a reduced ta with a slightly longer stem and no headmark.</p>
                    <p>Original punctuation. The sole punctuation mark is a vertical bar in line 18, which does not quite reach the baseline. See also the apparatus to line 18.</p>
                    <p>Other palaeographic observations. Anusvāra may be above the character to which it belongs, or at headline level to the right. It is generally a plain dot, but it may also be a circle or a crescent shape as a partial circle as in l1 śrīmatāṁ. Ca is sometimes indistinguishable from va (although ideally, the former's body is more elongated and notched on top and bottom) and has been read with goodwill where expected. There is a very unusually executed conjunct mpū in line 6, see the apparatus. Long ī and short i are as a rule not distinguished (the single exceptions are two instances of śrī, l11 and l22); I read short i and emend to ī. The old/northern cursive lo occurs in line 10. The writing at the end of 3r, after the blank space, is probably in the same hand as the rest of the text, but it is even less well-formed.
                      <!-- The script name(s) will be inserted here at a later stage from the metadata spreasheet. At this stage, you can mention here in a free-text paragraph any characteristics of the writing observed more than once in this inscription that seem unusual/uncommon or otherwise noteworthy given the general characteristics of the script in question. See EG 11.2. --></p>

For some reason, an <foreign>anusvāra</foreign> was not used to represent the nasal (although the two seem to be wholly interchangeable, cf. <foreign>°ālaṁkārālaṅkr̥ta</foreign> in the previous line). Instead, a full <foreign>ma</foreign> was written, followed by <foreign>pū</foreign>, to which a vertical stroke (resembling a superscript <foreign>r</foreign>) was attached to indicate that it is to be read in conjunction with the previous glyph.</note>

There seem to be two, and the word <foreign>punaḥ</foreign> seems to function as the introduction of a plot other than the first. But this word is used twice, and the last “to the west” does not seem to be connected to anything. The intent may have been to say that the 42 <foreign>nivartana</foreign>s are not the total extent but the size of a third plot (with the size of the first two being unspecified), and that this third plot lies to the west of the second, but that would logically overlap the Kuduti field. As indicated in the edition, space was probably left blank for the specifics of the land and filled incompletely at a later time. Even though plenty of space remains blank on the plate, there is no record of the king’s actual command (to respect the donees’ rights) or of other details (such as the occasion of the donation, exemption from tax, and a libation). The description of the plots and their boundaries may thus also be unfinished.</note></p>

<div type="commentary">
   <p>The plates are in extraordinarily good condition.</p>
   <p>According to the description in <bibl><ptr target="bib:ARIE1990-1991"/><citedRange>5</citedRange></bibl>, the seal face shows a sun as well as a moon above the legend, and the legend is <foreign>viṣamasiddhi</foreign>, whereas all other known grants of Maṅgi have seals with <foreign>vijayasiddhi</foreign>. On the seal presently associated with the plates in the museum, the seal legend is <foreign>vijayasiddhi</foreign> and there is no sun in the emblem. There is a slight chance that the seal has been misplaced and another grant’s seal attached to these plates, but I believe it is more likely that the ARIE is mistaken.</p>
