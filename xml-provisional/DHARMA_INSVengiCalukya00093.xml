        <note>At the regular level of the line, the text is <foreign>ala<unclear>ṁ</unclear>kariṣṇosva</foreign>. A slightly smaller <foreign>sa</foreign>, without a headmark, is engraved above <foreign>sva</foreign>, where the previous line skips a space for a descender in the first line. I am not entirely certain this is a later addition; it may also be a way to economise on space and to avoid creating a very deep descender here.</note>

        <note>The beginning segment is very uncertainly read; in particular, the characters I restore as <foreign>da-ve</foreign> are not recognisable and there may be only a single inscribed character here. The text is, however, definitely not <foreign>ṣaḍ-aṁga-vido</foreign>, which is the only other plausible restoration that I can think of in the context.</note>
      </app>
      <app loc="8">
        <lem>viṣ<unclear>a</unclear>y<unclear>e</unclear></lem>
        <note>The name of the <foreign>viṣaya</foreign> seems to have been omitted. The writing is badly effaced around the hole and the hole itself has dilated to some extent from its original size, so it is not entirely impossible that one or two characters were squeezed in at the edges of the hole and have become indiscernible. But if so, these must have been both small and out of line. The village Ariyeṟu in another grant of Viṣṇuvardhana III (see the next note) is located in the Attili <foreign>viṣaya</foreign>.</note>
      </app>
      <app loc="9">
        <lem>Ari<add place="below"><unclear>ye</unclear></add>ṟa-</lem>
        <note>It seems to me that one additional character, in all probability <foreign>ye</foreign>, has been inscribed below and to the left of <foreign>ṟa</foreign>, which is above and to the right of <foreign>M</foreign> in the next line. Another charter of Viṣṇuvardhana III, not published accessibly, is reported (<bibl><ptr target="bib:ARIE1924-1925"/><citedRange>7, 76-77</citedRange></bibl>) to grant land at the village of Ariyeṟu to a Brahmin named Nūriśarman. It seems likely that this grant is at the same village.</note>

        <lem>p<unclear>ū</unclear>rv<unclear>v</unclear>a-sī<unclear>ma</unclear></lem>
        <note>The last character is too small for a regular <foreign>ma</foreign> and seems to lack a headmark. This may be simply because this line (slanting downward and ending well before the right-hand edge of the plate) did not have sufficient space. It is also possible that <foreign>pūrvvasmiM</foreign> (intended for <foreign>pūrvvasmiN</foreign> or <foreign>pūrvvasyāM</foreign>) was inscribed here.</note>

        <note>This word is extremely uncertainly read/reconstructed, based partly on the subsequent <foreign>udaka-sthāna</foreign>, itself tentatively read.</note>

      <app loc="19">
        <lem><unclear cert="low">tāny e</unclear><unclear>va narake</unclear> vase<supplied reason="omitted">T</supplied></lem>
        <note>There definitely seem to be two (or even more) overlapping texts in this section, see also the commentary. I am not entirely certain that what I read here, which is not the correct ending of this stanza, is the final inscribed text, but it is certainly the better discernible one. It is not impossible that <foreign>viṣṭhā</foreign> overlaps the first three characters of my reading, but I cannot discern anything resembling <foreign>yāṁ jāyate kr̥miḥ</foreign>. There also seem to be vestiges of <foreign>bda</foreign> (or perhaps <foreign>ṣṭa</foreign>) followed by <foreign>ṣṭha</foreign> where I read <foreign>ke va</foreign>.</note>

<div type="commentary">
<p>Note that there is also an Ariyeṟu grant purporting to have been issued by Viṣṇuvardhana III. In order to distinguish the two more explicitly, I refer to the other one as the <ref target="DHARMA_INSVengiCalukya00105.xml">Gaṇapavaram plates</ref>.</p>
<p>The recto of plate 3 may well be a palimpsest. The writing is awkward and poorly preserved, but in many places on this page, there seem to be two overlapping characters. This is especially noticeable in the latter part of lines 18-20. It is impossible to read the earlier writing; in fact, it is often impossible to tell whether a recognisable character component belongs to the earlier or the later text.</p>
