                    <p>The only halantas character occurring in the text is an unclear final M in line 35, which seems to be a reduced and simplified ma.</p>
                    <p>Original punctuation marks are plain verticals, used in profusion for segmentation into units smaller than sentences, and often in groups to punctuate larger units. Elaborate florets mark the ends of sections, and the end of the text is signified, in addition to three vertical bars, by a sign that I classify as a gomūtra symbol with tails to both the left and right, but which may in fact be two separate symbols, a plain circle and a clockwise spiral with a tail to the right, plus some damage.</p>
                    <p>Other palaeographic observations. Anusvāra is typically a small circle at head height to the right of the character to which it belongs. Headmarks are prominent V shapes. Dependent e is often (e.g. l2 mahāsena, l5 samuditendu) written by closing the left-hand stroke of the headmark downward into a small circle. The glyph for li in l26 cānupālitā has a flat body not normally found in Eastern Cālukya inscriptions, but which is attested for example in the Reyūru Grant of Pallava Narasimhavarman (<bibl><ptr target="bib:Desai1951-1952_01"/></bibl>), written in an ornate Andhra-style script. The same form (much the same as the subscript form used in lla) is also found in the <ref target="DHARMA_INSVengiCalukya00056.xml">first Peddāpurappāḍu set</ref>. Rare initial Ai occurs in line 25, and an unusual glyph in line 26 that I cannot identify with confidence is probably initial Au (possibly Ū).

At this stage, you can mention here in a free-text paragraph any characteristics of the writing observed more than once in this inscription that seem unusual/uncommon or otherwise noteworthy given the general characteristics of the script in question.

        <note>The <ref target="DHARMA_INSVengiCalukya00056.xml">first Peddāpurappāḍu set</ref>, ll17-18, reads <foreign>mahā-bali-vaiśvadeva-navakarmma-saraṇārtthaM</foreign> (now confirmed from photos of the original) in the same context. I feel that <foreign>saraṇa</foreign> is more appropriate to the context than <foreign>śaraṇa</foreign>, but I am far from certain;<foreign>ācaraṇa</foreign> or some other word may have been intended in both cases.</note>

        <note>ARIE reports the district as Nātavāḍi. The reading is clear here, and the name Nātavāḍi does not occur in the charter. However, no other charter of the dynasty mentions an Aṣṭami-viṣaya.

        <note>Part of the first character is obliterated, only a curve resembling a Latin C remains. Its shape corresponds exactly to other instances of initial <foreign>U</foreign>, but the text generally observes standard sandhi, so I am hesitant to read <foreign>U</foreign> here. Another candidate on the basis of shape would be <foreign>ṭa</foreign>, but I believe that <foreign>o</foreign> sandhi is even less likely before that character. My impression is that the glyph is not tall enough to be part of <foreign>la</foreign>, and some vestige of the central part of <foreign>la</foreign> also ought to be visible if that character had been engraved. The bottom of the extant part is distinctly not notched, ruling out readings such as <foreign>ḍa</foreign>, <foreign>da</foreign>, <foreign>va</foreign> and <foreign>ma</foreign>.</note>

        <note>This character is clearly recognisable, but faint and has probably been hammered or rubbed out. It is below the centre of the hole, positioned slightly lower than the rest of line 23, to which it is in all probability not connected at all. I have no insight into why it may have been engraved here. There is no indication whatsoever of the plate being a palimpsest, and I consider this sign unlikely to serve pagination.</note>

<div type="commentary">
<p>I understand the charter to endow a single Jain temple (<foreign>jinālaya</foreign>) located in Kasumi with primary and secondary plots located at three different villages. This is supported by the dative singular <foreign>jinālayāya</foreign> in the preamble (l. 10), as well as probably by the phrase <foreign>tasyaiva pratibaddhe</foreign> introducing the fields at the second and third village. However, the way the three parts of the grant are described implies that that each of these villages has a Jain temple (or that one is to be built in each), since the relationship of the village to the temple is expressed through the genitive in the first item, and through a compound in the other two. I assume, with some hesitation, that all of these were meant, instead, as locatives (or were intended, with a loose attitude to genitives and compounds, to qualify the respective <foreign>kṣetra</foreign> rather than the respective <foreign>jinālaya</foreign>). However, perhaps three satellite temples of the main temple in Kasumi are endowed hereby. I assume, without being certain, that <foreign>sthala-bhoga</foreign>, applied to the primary plots at each village, is equivalent to <foreign>tala-bhoga</foreign>, which probably means <q>land granted for the maintenance of a temple at the time of its consecration</q> (<bibl><ptr target="bib:Sircar1966_01"/><citedRange unit="entry">tala-bhoga</citedRange></bibl>).</p>
<p>According to C. A. Padmanabha Sastry (<bibl rend="omitname"><ptr target="bib:PadmanabhaSastry1994_01"/><citedRange>46</citedRange></bibl>), the authenticity of these plates has been questioned by P. V. Parabrahma Sastry first in an issue of <title>Bhārati</title> subsequent to October 1983 (no closer details). In his English paper touching on the subject Parabrahma Sastry (<bibl rend="omitname"><ptr target="bib:ParabrahmaSastry1990_01"/><citedRange>168</citedRange></bibl>) asserts that the palaeography of the present plates is <q>clearly of a later period, say <gap reason="ellipsis"/> tenth century A. D.</q>, and that the <foreign>varāha</foreign> emblem was never used before the time of Vijayāditya II. Neither of these seems to be a foregone conclusion to me. The writing of this set is much neater than that of the other two Peddāpurappāḍu sets, and it does exhibit some late features such as the v-shaped headmarks and the complexly curved glyph for <foreign>ja</foreign>, so its authenticity is not beyond doubt. Parabrahma Sastry apparently considers the grant an authentic reissue of an earlier grant, not a forgery.</p>
