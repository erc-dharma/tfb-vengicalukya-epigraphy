        <note>NLR only observes that the text from <foreign>aṣṭottara</foreign> is half an <foreign>anuṣṭubh</foreign> stanza. I prefer to assume that we are dealing with a full stanza here, though it is possible that the first hemistich has indeed been converted into prose. The <ref target="DHARMA_INSVengiCalukya00024.xml">Bezvāḍa plates of Bhīma I</ref>, which contains a practically identical genealogy, has corrupt prose here: <foreign>tat-suto vijayādityaḥ catvāriṁśat samaḥ</foreign>. Other grants of the dynasty describe the length of Vijayāditya II's reign in <foreign>anuṣṭubh</foreign> (though not juxtaposed to the extant hemistich here) as <foreign>catvāriṁśat samāṣṭabhiḥ</foreign> or <foreign>catvāriṁśat samās samaḥ</foreign>. There is no way to determine whether a reign of forty or forty-eight years was assigned here. The last character in line 7 may perhaps be <foreign>T</foreign> or <foreign>tsa</foreign> rather than <foreign>ta</foreign>.

        <note>The meaning of the lost text was certainly as restored by NLR, but the words may have been different. The <ref target="DHARMA_INSVengiCalukya00024.xml">Bezvāḍa plates of Bhīma I</ref> have <foreign>samaḥ tan-nandano</foreign> here.</note>

        <note>I assume that NLR could read the text he prints as clear and could estimate the number of lost characters with some precision, in which case his restoration is perfectly plausible. But if he was guessing where he admits no doubt, then the text could have run somewhat differently. The <ref target="DHARMA_INSVengiCalukya00024.xml">Bezvāḍa plates of Bhīma I</ref> read <foreign>tad-bhrātur yyuvarājasya vikramāditya-bhūpateḥ putro bhīmaḥ</foreign>. The phrase <foreign>tad-bhrātur yyuvarājasya</foreign> may also be the beginning of an <foreign>anuṣṭubh</foreign> stanza.</note>

        <note>The scope of correction may be somewhat larger; possibly, <foreign>triṁśataṁ vvarṣāṇi</foreign> was first engraved, then <foreign>taṁ</foreign> was overwritten with <foreign>dva</foreign> and the subsequent characters corrected accordingly.

        <note>At the end of line 10 I see nothing recognisable beyond <foreign>bhū</foreign>, but I assume that NLR's <foreign>bhu</foreign> is based on vestiges.

        <note>I hesitantly accept NLR's reading for the first part of this segment, because I have nothing better to offer. I see no vowel marker in <foreign>dru</foreign>, and the character may also be <foreign>pra</foreign>, since its bottom seems to be joined to the vertical stroke NLR reads as the tail of the following <foreign>ta</foreign>. The body of <foreign>mā</foreign> is partly obliterated but it is certainly wider than expected, with an extra stroke that looks like a greater-than sign between the body and the vowel marker. At the end of this segment, <foreign>to</foreign> seems quite certain, so an <foreign>avagraha</foreign> probably needs to be supplied after it.</note>

        <note>The reading is highly doubtful. This was almost certainly a stanza in the original. NLR suggests that its metre may have been <foreign>āryā</foreign>, but if his reading is largely correct, then this is prosodically impossible. Given the lengths of adjacent lines (29 characters each in lines 14 and 15; 31 in line 18), the total length of the stanza would have been about 40 characters, with about 2 in the first lacuna and about 13 in the second. It may perhaps have been in <foreign>viyoginī</foreign> (42 characters total), but this too is only possible if NLR's reading is substantially incorrect.</note>

        <note>NLR prints eight dots for the first lacuna and two for the second. It is not clear to me whether he intends the number of dots to represent the length of lacunae; elsewhere in the text, some of his lacunae seem to correspond to my estimates of lacuna length at two dots per <foreign>akṣara</foreign>, but elsewhere at one dot per <foreign>akṣara</foreign>.</note>

<div type="commentary">
<p>This set of plates is a palimpsest, with two plates of an Eastern Cālukya grant re-utilised for a Vijayanagar grant (edited in the same article). Only plates 2 and 3 of the original grant are preserved, with the genealogy extant from Jayasiṁha I onward. The pages of the original grant are not in the same order as those of the later one, so that EC page 2r is Vijayanagar 2r; EC 2v = V 2v; EC 3r = V 1r and EC 3v = V 1v. At least one, probably two additional plates at the end of the EC grant are also lost. The two remaining plates have been re-cut into the shape of a typical Vijayanagar grant, causing the loss of some characters at the corners. The plates, when found, were bound by a ring without a seal.</p>
<p>Stanza 3 (<foreign>śārdūlavikrīḍita</foreign>) has a caesura in the middle of a word in <foreign>pāda</foreign> b. If NLR reads the text correctly, then <foreign>pāda</foreign> c of stanza 4 (<foreign>śārdūlavikrīḍita</foreign>) has muta cum liquida licence, a caesura in the middle of a word (before a suffix), and enjambement (at a compound boundary) from this <foreign>pāda</foreign> to the next.</p>

  <p>Edited from the original by N. Lakshminarayan Rao (<bibl rend="omitname"><ptr target="bib:LakshminarayanRao1939-1940_01"/><citedRange unit="item">A</citedRange></bibl>), with photographs of 2v and 3r, without translation. The present edition by Dániel Balogh is based on a collation of Lakshminarayan Rao's edition with photographs kept at the ASI (Mysore). The set of ASI photos likewise records only 2v and 3r, but they are somewhat better legible than the published ones. I assume that Lakshminarayan Rao was able to make out more from the original than I can from the photos, and thus accept his readings unless counterindicated. For the parts without visual documentation, I follow his edition verbatim unless otherwise noted.</p>
