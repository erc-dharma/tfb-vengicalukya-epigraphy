                    <p>The plates are written in the "early Telugu-Kannada" script employed in the late grants of the Eastern Cālukyas, unlike all other known Kalyāṇa plates, which are in Nagari. The retroflex ḷ is very frequently (but without apparent consistency) used in place of the regular Sanskrit l. In the edition, the spelling has been normalised for confidently read Sanskrit words, but left unchanged for uncertain readings and names. Upadhmānīya and jihvāmūlīya are frequently used.</p>

<div type="commentary">
<p>The preamble of all other known Kalyāṇa Cāḷukya copper charters is highly standardised, to the degree of being verbatim identical in most respects. The present document parallels that structure in many ways, but the details are entirely different. In the comparative notes below, "standard" refers to the text of the known later charters; citations from the standard are based on the Kauthem plates of Vikramāditya V (<bibl><ptr target="bib:Fleet1887_02"/></bibl>) with silent emendation and normalisation.</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="1-4">The standard commences with the standard Cālukyan invocation <foreign>jayaty āviṣkr̥taṁ viṣṇor</foreign>, followed by a second stanza in praise of the Varāha <foreign>avatāra</foreign>, then a prayer for the king's victory. The ruler is not equated to a deity in the standard. His epithet is Akalaṁkacarita in Kauthem and Tintiṇi; Jagadekamalla in Miraj, Daulatabad; Trailokyamalla in Narihaḷḷa, and Tribhuvanamalla in Nīlgunda, Kallasāmbi. Placed at the beginning of the second hemistich, the epithet is echoed by the word <foreign>akalaṁka</foreign> shortly afterward, implying that the stanza was originally composed for a king bearing this style. In his edition of the Kauthem plates, Fleet assumes that this king was Satyāśraya, who did bear this epithet according to the testimony of several stone inscriptions. He therefore concludes that at the time the Kauthem plates were issued, Satyāśraya was still alive but had made over the sovereignty to his nephew Vikramāditya V. Given, however, that the same epithet is found in this stanza of the Tintiṇi plates of Jayasiṁha II, this explanation is no longer tenable. Either several kings of the line were styled Akalaṅkacarita, or the stanza of the standard eulogy began to be adapted only during the reign of Jayasiṁha II. I am not aware of other occurrences of the present text's epithet Paracakramalla. It is probably another epithet of Satyāśraya II, since his father Taila II was styled Āhavamalla. The latter appears also in line 77 of the present text, where Satyāśraya is described as a bee at the feet of Āhavamalla.</p>
<p>The prose dynastic eulogy in lines 7 to 13 (from <foreign>svasti</foreign> to <foreign>udbhava-bhūmiḥ</foreign>) is identical to the standard, except for the following details. The phrase <foreign>aśvamedhāvabhr̥tha-snāna-pavitrīkr̥ta-gātrāṇāṁ</foreign> is absent in the standard. In place of <foreign>-dhvajādi-viśeṣa-cihnānāṁ</foreign>, the standard has only <foreign>-dhvajānāṁ</foreign>. In place of <foreign>°ārāti-maṇḍalānāṁ</foreign>, the standard has <foreign>°ārāti-rāja-maṇḍalānāṁ</foreign>. In place of <foreign>vijayāditya-viṣṇuvarddhanādi</foreign>, the standard has <foreign>viṣṇuvarddhana-vijayādityādi</foreign>. Since the actual royal epithets are always Samastabhuvanāśraya Vijayāditya and Sarvalokāśraya Viṣṇuvardhana, the arrangement <foreign>samasta-bhuvanāśraya-sarvva-lokāśraya-vijayāditya-viṣṇuvarddhanādi</foreign> found here is superior. Finally, the standard has <foreign>rāja-ratnānām</foreign> in place of <foreign>rāja-vara-ratnānām</foreign>.</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="5">The first syllable of this stanza employs licence, using a single long syllable where two short syllables are expected by the metre. The corresponding <foreign>mālinī</foreign> stanza in the standard likewise lists the Nala, Durjaya, Kadamba, Maurya, Rāṣṭrakūṭa and Kalacuri dynasties (in this order) as defeated rivals.</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="6-7">In the standard, a <foreign>mālinī</foreign> stanza making the same general claims (but without naming any defeated southern dynasties) corresponds to this pair of <foreign>anuṣṭubh</foreign>.</p>
<p>The connecting prose in lines 18-19 corresponds to prose expressing the same meaning in the standard.</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="8">In the standard too, Jayasiṁha is also introduced with a <foreign>śārdūlavikrīḍita</foreign> stanza, but the contents are different.</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="9">In the standard, the second stanza on Jayasiṁha is likewise a <foreign>vasantatilakā</foreign>, but it claims victory over the Rāṣṭrakūṭa Indra, son of Kr̥ṣṇa.</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="10">The standard does not have a third stanza on Jayasiṁha.</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="11">The verse introducing Raṇarāga in the standard is also an <foreign>āryā</foreign> playing on the term <foreign>raṇa-rāga</foreign>, and in addition <foreign>hara-caraṇa-rāga</foreign>.</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="12">The introduction of Pulakeśi in the standard is another <foreign>āryā</foreign>, asserting that he ruled in Vātāpi.</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="13">The standard’s second stanza on Pulakeśi is a <foreign>mālinī</foreign> claiming that he gave away two thousand villages to the <foreign>r̥tvik</foreign>s of his <foreign>aśvamedha</foreign>.</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="14">At this point, the standard also introduces Kīrtivarman in a <foreign>mālinī</foreign> stanza, recounting his victories over the Nalas, Mauryas and Kadambas.</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="15">The standard has a <foreign>mandākrāntā</foreign> introducing Maṁgalīśa (sic) here. He is said to be famed for <foreign>sarva-dvīpākramaṇa</foreign>, to have crossed (<foreign>ullaṁghya</foreign>) a body of water (<foreign>abdhi</foreign>) by a pontoon of boats (<foreign>nau-setu-baṁdhair</foreign>), and to have subjugated the Kalacuris.</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="16">Much of this stanza is illegible and has been tentatively reconstructed. It is quite certainly in a mixture of <foreign>vasantatilakā</foreign> with <foreign>indravajrā</foreign> in the third quarter, apparently due to the impossibility of fitting the name Satyāśraya to <foreign>vasantatilakā</foreign>. A similar, but differently arranged, mixture of metres is found in stanza 19. Alternatively, the engraver may have omitted some trick used by the composer to fit the name to the metre (e.g. <foreign>satya-sahitāśraya-</foreign>?). The standard’s corresponding verse about Maṁgalīśa is a <foreign>mandākrāntā</foreign> like the previous one. It relates that Maṁgalīśa had seized the throne only because his elder brother’s son (<foreign>jyeṣṭha-bhrātuḥ ... suta-vare</foreign>) Satyāśraya was an infant (<foreign>arbhakatvād</foreign>) at the time, and willingly resigned in the latter's favour (<foreign>tasmin pratyārpipad ... mahīṁ</foreign>) upon his attainment of young adulthood (<foreign>yūni</foreign>). The standard stanza’s emphasis on the moral rectitude of this act (<foreign>cālukyānāṁ ka iva hi patho dharmyataḥ pracyaveta</foreign>) may be paralleled by the phrase <foreign>vinaya-bhūṣaṇa</foreign> in the present text, if this compound applied to Maṁgalīśa.</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="17">The standard’s next verse is a <foreign>vasantatilakā</foreign> offering generic praise for Satyāśraya and mentioning his defeat of Harṣa.</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="18">In the standard too, Satyāśraya’s successor (there explicitly called his son) is introduced in a <foreign>drutavilambita</foreign> stanza and praised in general terms. The stanza there also involves <foreign>prāsa</foreign> on the name, with <foreign>aḍamarī-</foreign>, <foreign>dviḍ-amarī-</foreign> and <foreign>mr̥ḍam ariṣṭa-</foreign>. The name of this person has always been understood to be Neḍamari, as perhaps first stated by Wathen (<bibl><ptr target="bib:Wathen1836_01"/></bibl>). The dental <foreign>d</foreign> is quite certain in the present text, but a retroflex <foreign>ḍ</foreign> cannot be ruled out fully and may be accepted as correct, as it is recorded in Nāgarī (where the distinction from <foreign>d</foreign> is conspicuous) in all the other copper plates of the dynasty. However, in this record, the name unquestionably begins with an initial <foreign>E</foreign>. In fact, the standard eulogy also permits that analysis. The received readings are <foreign>°odvahaṁneḍamari</foreign> (Kauthem, Daulatabad), <foreign>°odvahanneḍamari</foreign> (Miraj, Narihaḷḷa) and <foreign>°odvahanniḍamari</foreign>. The <foreign>e</foreign> of the name is certainly short, as proved both by the prosodic requirement and by the variant involving <foreign>i</foreign>. Therefore, <foreign>°odvahann eḍamari</foreign> may be regarded as standard sandhi. In the light of the new record, the name of this alleged ancestor of the Kalyāṇa Cāḷukyas should therefore be revised to Eḍamari.</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="19">This stanza is doubtless in a mixture of <foreign>indravajrā</foreign> and <foreign>vasantatilakā</foreign>. The corresponding verse of the standard is an <foreign>upajāti</foreign> (<foreign>indravajrā</foreign> and <foreign>upendravajrā</foreign>), which also refers to Ādityavarman as <foreign>bhū-vallabho</foreign> and introduces him as <foreign>ādityavarmārjjita-puṇya-karmā</foreign>.</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="20">The standard introduces this Vikramāditya with half an <foreign>anuṣṭubh</foreign>, continuing to Yuddhamalla in the same stanza.</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="21">The standard dedicates no separate stanza to Yuddhamalla.</p>
<p>The passage in lines 43 to 46 seems to be prose, although it may include a short stanza. The legible bit beginning with <foreign>Asahya-tejā</foreign> yields <foreign>vaṁśastha</foreign> if we apply hypersandhi (<foreign>-tejāpy</foreign>) or non-standard declension (<foreign>-tejo ’py</foreign>). The text after this possible <foreign>vaṁśastha</foreign> line can contain at best one additional line, while the preceding text does not appear to fit any metre. In the standard, the genealogy continues in <foreign>anuṣṭubh</foreign> (no connecting prose) with Yuddhamalla’s son Vijayāditya who defeated warriors of all lands in single combat</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="22">The standard introduces Vikramāditya in just a quarter of an <foreign>anuṣṭubh</foreign> stanza.</p>
<p>Analogously to the prose in lines 48 to 50, the standard describes Kīrtivarman II’s loss of the realm in the rest of the <foreign>anuṣṭubh</foreign> that commenced with the introduction of Vikramāditya. Another <foreign>anuṣṭubh</foreign> stanza then begins with the mention of the nameless brother, who is there too described as (or named?) <foreign>bhīma-parākrama</foreign>.</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="23">In the standard, Kīrtivarman III is introduced in the second half of the stanza that recounts the nameless brother, while Taila I gets the first quarter of the next <foreign>anuṣṭubh</foreign>.</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="24">The standard dedicates little over an <foreign>anuṣṭubh</foreign> quarter to Vikramāditya III.</p>
<p>The badly effaced passage in lines 53 to 57 certainly contained, or even consisted solely of, verse. Many of the tentatively read fragments suggest <foreign>anuṣṭubh</foreign>, including the full odd quarter <foreign>yasya tāpānaḷo dīpto</foreign>.  The corresponding part of the standard comprises the latter part of an <foreign>anuṣṭubh</foreign> about Bhīma, the son of Vikramāditya III, followed by another <foreign>anuṣṭubh</foreign> about Bhīma’s son Ayyaṇa, who married the daughter of Kr̥ṣṇa, identified as the Rāṣṭrakūṭa Kr̥ṣṇa II.</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="25">The standard introduces Vikramāditya IV, the son of Ayyaṇa and the Rāṣṭrakūṭa princess, in an <foreign>āryā</foreign> stanza.</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="26">In the standard, the marriage of Vikramāditya IV to Vonthādevī, daughter of the Cedi king Lakṣmaṇa, is narrated in a <foreign>sugīti</foreign> stanza. (Fleet was not able to identify this rare metre involving 32 morae in the first hemistich and 27 in the second, which does, however, occur in the Veṅgī Cālukya corpus.)</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="27">The corresponding stanza in the standard is a <foreign>mālinī</foreign> about the birth of Taila II (named in that stanza) from Bonthādevī and Vikramāditya IV, also involving divine comparisons.</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="28">The standard has an <foreign>āryā</foreign> stanza similar in many details, stating that the splitting of the globes of enemy elephants was child’s play to Taila, as it is to a lion, which possesses innate strength. The latter is expressed with the word <foreign>hari</foreign>, and some of the capabilities ascribed to Taila there seem to pun on that word, being probably associated with Viṣṇu.</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="29-32">The standard dedicates two <foreign>śārdūlavikrīḍita</foreign> stanzas to the praise of Taila, the first announcing his victory over the Rāṣṭrakūṭa Karkara (Karka II), and the second his imprisonment of an Utpala who had previously defeated or intimidated Hūṇas, Māravas and Caidyas.</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="33-35">The standard has an <foreign>āryā</foreign> stanza and an <foreign>upajāti</foreign> relating Taila’s marriage to Jākavvā, daughter of the Rāṣṭrakūṭa Bhammaha.</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="36">The standard also narrates the birth of Satyāśraya in an <foreign>anuṣṭubh</foreign>, then continues along its own lines with his younger brother Yaśovarman.</p>
