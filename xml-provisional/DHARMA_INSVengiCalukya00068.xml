Anusvāra is above the character to which it belongs, or above headline to the right of that character; occasionally atop the next character, e.g. l13 kuṭuṁbinaḥ within the i marker. Short and long i/ī are not clearly distinguishable, but i seems to be a closed circle while ī appears to be open on the left, with a little hook at the opening; e.g. sti and śrī side by side in line 1; śī in line 5 is good example of the long ī. Headmarks are large horizontal lines with small horns on each side.

        <note>There is little damage here; in fact the most damaged part of this locus is the last three characters, of whose reading I am quite certain. The preceding characters, however, are ambiguous on account of the script and the execution, and I am unable to offer a satisfactory reading. It is likely that multiple scribal errors are involved in addition to the ambiguous characters. The first problematic character, read as <foreign>ṇa</foreign>, might well be <foreign>nā</foreign> or <foreign>vā</foreign>, and reading <foreign>ya</foreign> or <foreign>śā</foreign> is not out of the question. The second definitely looks like <foreign>ggi</foreign>, but either of its consonant components may perhaps be <foreign>dh</foreign> instead of <foreign>g</foreign>. This is probably followed by a <foreign>visarga</foreign>, but it is just possible that this is instead a vowel marker (for <foreign>e</foreign> or part of <foreign>o</foreign>) attached to the next character. The third character looks much, but not entirely, like the first, so all possibilities listed for that also apply here, with the added complication that there may be a vowel marker prefixed to this character. This is definitely followed by <foreign>rā</foreign>, and the next two characters resemble one another, but are not identical. I read the consonant of the first as <foreign>t</foreign>, because this is the only way I can account for what looks like a notch in the upper outline of its body, which I take to be the hook of <foreign>t</foreign>. However, its shape in general looks more like <foreign>bh</foreign>, <foreign>ś</foreign> or <foreign>n</foreign>, less probably <foreign>v</foreign> or <foreign>c</foreign>. The second of the two similar characters is most likely <foreign>bhī</foreign>, but <foreign>śī</foreign> and <foreign>nī</foreign> are also possible. Any of the <foreign>i</foreign>-s in this stretch may be either short or long; I read long <foreign>ī</foreign> where the loop is open on the left, but this may be random variation. The closest to an intelligible phrase that I can obtain from the text is <foreign>vāri-rāśi-śītīkr̥ta</foreign> (assuming scribal omission of <foreign>ri</foreign>), but I have no inkling what <foreign>ṇaggiḥ</foreign> may be. I would expect this phrase to resemble the preceding and following qualifier, and thus to include a simile with <foreign>iva</foreign> and a double entendre. The double entendre may perhaps be that Vijayāditya's army (<foreign>cakra</foreign>) is “cooled” (i.e., its martial ardour is diminished) only when it reaches the ocean; in this, he may be compared to the moon (?), whose orbit (<foreign>cakra</foreign>) is cooled by water and by the signs of the zodiac - but this is probably just my forced attempt to make sense of the text. There is also a possibility that the end of this locus should be read <foreign>śitīkr̥ta</foreign> (perhaps with a play on “sharpened discus” and “brightened domain”); or that <foreign>ivārāti</foreign> (perhaps with wordplay involving “enemy” and “not favour”) is to be read in the middle of this chunk. Related grants offer no better clue; the only comparable expressions involving <foreign>cakra</foreign> that I am aware of are <foreign>cakradhara Ivāpratihata-cakraḥ</foreign> in the <ref target="DHARMA_INSVengiCalukya00004.xml">Peṇukapaṟu grant of Jayasiṁha I</ref> and <foreign>viṣṇor iva sva-cakra-nandakasya</foreign> in the <ref target="DHARMA_INSVengiCalukya00021.xml">Koṟṟapaṟṟu grant of Vijayāditya II</ref>.</note>

        <note>The ARIE report gives the father's name as Bandhuśarman. While the initial <surplus>śa</surplus> is not unambiguously drawn, <foreign>ndhu</foreign> can be safely excluded. Compare <foreign>rvva</foreign> in line 13 and especially line 18.</note>

        <note>The ARIE report records the name of the village as Maṅgaveḍu. There is definitely no <foreign>ṅ</foreign> here, though an <foreign>anusvāra</foreign> may be present. The vertical vowel marker between <foreign>g</foreign> and <foreign>v</foreign> in my opinion bends to the left at the top, and is thus probably associated with <foreign>g</foreign> rather than with the next character.</note>

It seems likely that starting out with Viṣṇuvardhana is a mistake in the composition, which was corrected by adding Vijayāditya afterward. This may have been simple oversight, or perhaps the text of the charter was based on a grant of the king’s father (Viṣṇuvardhana IV or V), which would have mentioned the grandfather (Viṣṇuvardhana III or IV) first. The composer of the present charter may have mechanically reproduced Viṣṇuvardhana here, and then changed the wording to make him the father of the present king.</note> who attained victory in the clash of many a battle and who was eager to adorn the lineage of the majestic Caḷukyas—who are of the Mānavya <foreign>gotra</foreign> which is praised by the entire world, who are sons of Harīti, who attained kingship by the grace of Kauśikī’s boon, who are protected by the band of Mothers, who were deliberately appointed <supplied reason="explanation">to kingship</supplied> by Lord Mahāsena, to whom the realms of adversaries instantaneously submit at the <supplied reason="subaudible">mere</supplied> sight of the superior Boar emblem they have acquired by the grace of the divine Nārāyaṇa, and whose bodies have been hallowed through washing in the purificatory ablutions <supplied reason="explanation"><foreign>avabhr̥tha</foreign></supplied> of the Aśvamedha sacrifice—; grandson of King <supplied reason="explanation"><foreign>mahārāja</foreign></supplied> Vijayāditya <supplied reason="explanation">I or II</supplied>; <supplied reason="subaudible">namely</supplied> the Supreme Lord <supplied reason="explanation"><foreign>parameśvara</foreign></supplied> of Emperors <supplied reason="explanation"><foreign>mahārājādhirāja</foreign></supplied> and Supreme Sovereign <supplied reason="explanation"><foreign>parama-bhaṭṭāraka</foreign></supplied> Vijayāditya <supplied reason="explanation">II or III</supplied>—who desires the exaltation of his allies as Mount Meru <seg rend="pun">which indicates the rising of the sun</seg>; whose circle <supplied reason="explanation" cert="low">domain</supplied> is made <gap reason="ellipsis"/> <note>See the apparatus to line 10 for some thoughts on the phrase that I am unable to interpret here.</note>; and who gives rise to prosperity as the ocean <seg rend="pun">produced Lakṣmī</seg>—commands all householders <supplied reason="explanation"><foreign>kuṭumbin</foreign></supplied>—including foremost the overseers <supplied reason="explanation"><foreign>kūṭaka</foreign></supplied>— who reside in Gudravara district <supplied reason="explanation"><foreign>viṣaya</foreign></supplied> as follows:</p>

<div type="commentary">
<p>The ARIE report reads the name of the donated village as Maṁgaveḍu, and identifies it with modern Maṅginapūḍi in Bandar taluk of Kistna district. The reading seems doubtful to me, and I therefore prefer to name the charter after its findspot. The report identifies Krovaśiri with modern Krōsūru in Sattenapalle taluk of Guntur district. Several donees hailing from Krovaśiri are also mentioned in the <ref target="DHARMA_INSVengiCalukya00021.xml">Koṟṟapaṟṟu grant of Vijayāditya II</ref> (none of them are of the Bhāradvāja <foreign>gotra</foreign>).</p>
<p>The ARIE report further states that the <foreign>ājñapti</foreign> of the grant is Paṇḍaraṅga, “the bee at the lotus-feet of Guṇagāṅka-Vijayāditya.” Neither the name nor the description appear anywhere in the photos available online. The photos include one blank face, which is probably 1 recto, so it is possible that a description of the executor (perhaps an <foreign>anuṣṭubh</foreign> stanza) was written on 3 verso, of which no photo has been published.</p>
