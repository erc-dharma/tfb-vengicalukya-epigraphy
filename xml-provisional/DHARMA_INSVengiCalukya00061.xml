        <note>NR suggests the emendation <foreign>-vaśīkr̥tāśeṣārāti-maṇḍalānām</foreign>. However, this form does not seem to occur in related grants. In later grants of the dynasty, <foreign>-vaśīkr̥tārāti-maṇḍalānām</foreign> is standard, while several grants issued by the first few generations of rulers have <foreign>-vaśīkr̥tāśeṣa-mahībhr̥tām</foreign> or <foreign>-vaśīkr̥tāśeṣa-mahīkṣitām</foreign>. The two phrases seem to be confounded here.</note>

        <note>NR's emendation (in fact <foreign>pitr̥guṇaiṣca</foreign>, clearly a typographic mistake) renders the text intelligible, but has no parallel in related grants. Several of these (e.g. the <ref target="DHARMA_INSVengiCalukya00014.xml">Nutulapaṟu grant</ref> and <ref target="DHARMA_INSVengiCalukya00048.xml">London plates</ref> of Maṁgi Yuvarāja) describe Maṁgi with the words <foreign>samatiśayita-pitr̥-guṇa-śakti-sampanna</foreign>, where I prefer to emend to <foreign>-guṇaḥ</foreign>, separating this phrase from the next. It is very likely that something much the same was intended here.</note>

        <note>I do not find <foreign>ya</foreign> superfluous; assuming that <foreign>yaḥ</foreign> was intended, this is a perfectly normal way to connect to the subsequent string of qualifiers for the reigning king. However, if the received reading is indeed <foreign>pautraya</foreign> in the previous line, then it is also possible that the dative forms <foreign>pautrāya</foreign> and <foreign>putrāya</foreign> had been intended here, incorrectly, to describe the king.</note>

        <note>NR's tentative emendation (printed <foreign>manmadha</foreign>, a Devanagari typo) does not seem satisfactory. In the received text, the second character may be <foreign>ta</foreign> but looks more like <foreign>tha</foreign>. The third character is definitely not <foreign>ya</foreign>; in addition to a misshapen <foreign>pa</foreign>, it could be a misshapen <foreign>ca</foreign>. Related grants sometimes compare the king to the moon in similar phrase, compare <foreign>śaśalāñchanasyeva sakala-jagan-mano-nayanānandana-karasya</foreign> (of Viṣṇuvardhana I in the <ref target="DHARMA_INSVengiCalukya00008.xml">Niḍupaṟu grant of Jayasiṁha I</ref>) and <foreign>candra Iva sarvva-jana-mano-nayana-nandanaḥ</foreign> (of Jayasiṁha II in the <ref target="DHARMA_INSVengiCalukya00060.xml">Cendaṟa grant of Jayasiṁha II</ref>). Being immediately subsequent to a comparison to the sun (as in the second parallel cited here) also makes the moon likely here, and the word <foreign>kara</foreign> could well have been used punningly if the object of the comparison were indeed the moon. My best guess at the composer's intent is therefore <foreign>mr̥gāṅka</foreign>, but since this presumes an egregious scribal mistake, I do not make the emendation in the text. Emending to <foreign>mādhava</foreign> would be less invasive, but inferior in the context.</note>

        <note>In addition to the anomalies, this locus is confusing because of the descenders of <foreign>stu</foreign> and <foreign>smā</foreign> in the line above, the presence of scribal correction, and the faintness of the estampage. I am fairly certain that originally, <foreign>tahitri</foreign> was followed by <foreign>nandi</foreign> and a now illegible character that may have been <foreign>śa</foreign>, but also <foreign>ṣa</foreign> or <foreign>ma</foreign>. The first two of these were probably beaten out and replaced, lower down, by <foreign>yana</foreign>. The third, at the same height (and extending above and below the pre-correction character) was replaced by <foreign>ṇḍi</foreign> instead of the expected <foreign>ndi</foreign>. The <foreign>śa</foreign> after this is very faint and may also have been deleted or re-inscribed shallowly. After that, <foreign>mma</foreign> is positioned higher. Of the following <foreign>ṇa</foreign>, only the faintest trace is discernible in the estampage, and most of <foreign>pu</foreign> is also indistinct.</note>

        <note>My reading of the name is extremely tentative and partly conjectural, see also the commentary. The name may have been deleted in the original. Of the first character in line 14, only a headmark and part of an arc from the top of the body remain. These are consistent with reading g, and since the headmark is raised, a subscript consonant is likely. Of the following character, the headmark is distinct and the vestiges of the body imply <foreign>na</foreign>. Next, part of a headmark and a dependent <foreign>i</foreign> remain, but nothing of the body. Of the following character, there is again a largely discernible headmark and some vestiges of the body, from which sa is slightly more likely than <foreign>śa</foreign> (cf. the spelling of the next name in the line), but many other readings could be possible. The vestiges of the next character strongly suggest <foreign>rm</foreign>, and in any case, <foreign>śarmma</foreign> or <foreign>sarmma</foreign> is certainly expected here in the context. The following <foreign>ṇa</foreign> is pristine.</note>

        <note>The ARIE reporter gives the name of the district as <foreign><unclear>penn</unclear>atavāḍi</foreign>. Although my emendation results in two iterations of <foreign>asmābhiḥ</foreign> in the sentence, given the typical formulation of related grants I am certain that NR's emendation is inappropriate. No related charters use <foreign>asmai</foreign> in such a context, while many put <foreign>asmābhiḥ</foreign> here. The district names Nātavāḍi and Pennātavāḍi are both attested and may be identical or the latter may be an extension of the former.</note>

See also the second instance of the name in line 18. The actual reading begins beyond doubt with <foreign>koṇḍakaḻipḻo</foreign>. The last character's body is shaped like that of <foreign>la</foreign>, but it completely lacks the tail curving back and down above the body. The tail is present in all instances of <foreign>la</foreign> except for the two occurrences of this name here and in line 18 below. As it is, the received character could be read as <foreign>ba</foreign> in related inscriptions of a slightly later time, but again, all instances of <foreign>ba</foreign> in the present inscription differ from it in that they have a closed box for a body.</note>

        <note>I am very unhappy with this word and guess tentatively. Interestingly, the previous (and expected) instance of <foreign>pravarddhamāna</foreign> is right above this one.

There is nothing discernible between the possible <foreign>va</foreign> and the possible <foreign>ma</foreign>, and NR's <foreign>rddha</foreign> would have to have been much compressed to fit here. My alternative <foreign>rtta</foreign> would also have to have been compressed, but a faint stroke to the left of <foreign>tro</foreign> in the next line may be the remnant of a subscript <foreign>t</foreign>.
