                    <p>Halantas. Anusvāra is typically omitted, but in some places where an anusvāra would be expected, there are small raised characters resembling a Latin S, which I take to be final M-s (e.g. l3 rājyānāM, l5 vapuṣāM). The two instances on 3r are increasingly sketchy, with that in l23 phalaM looking like a small question mark, and that in l27 °kākinaM like a completely plain daṇḍa. Where actual   anusvāra is used, its placement is haphazard: in l23 datāṁ it is above the next character, while in l26 goraṁ it is to the left of ra.</p>
                    <p>Original punctuation marks. What seems to be a space filler symbol at the end of line 9 is about half a character tall, floating at the midline, shaped like a Latin Z with very short arms, or a vertical line with a top serif to the left and a bottom serif to the right. It is by and large identical in shape to the punctuation mark in line 14.</p>
                    <p>Other palaeographic observations. Consonants other than y are generally not doubled after r.
                      <!-- The script name(s) will be inserted here at a later stage from the metadata spreasheet. At this stage, you can mention here in a free-text paragraph any characteristics of the writing observed more than once in this inscription that seem unusual/uncommon or otherwise noteworthy given the general characteristics of the script in question.

        <note>The reading is clear, but this is all but impossible as a place name. The final <foreign>h</foreign> is conjoined to the following <foreign>va</foreign>, which in turn is part of the word continuing in the next line, so if eyeskip omission has taken place, then it was more than simply skipping some words at the end of the line. The toponym Urpuṭūru occurs in some cognate grants and may have been conflated with <foreign>upabr̥ṁhita</foreign> (as in l9). The ASI devanagari transcript shows this as <foreign>Upubraṁh</foreign>.</note>

<div type="commentary">
<p>There is some confusion in the ARIE report as to the numbering of the two Pamidimukkala plate sets. According to the reported contents (<bibl><ptr target="bib:ARIE1916-1917"/><citedRange unit="page">113-114</citedRange><citedRange unit="section">20</citedRange></bibl>), the issuer’s father is Jayasiṁha in No. 14 and Indra Bhaṭṭāraka in No. 15; and No. 14 is not dated while No. 15 is dated to the year 3. On the basis of this information, the plates I call <ref target="DHARMA_INSVengiCalukya00088.xml">Set 1, year 3</ref> correspond to No. 15, and those I call <ref target="DHARMA_INSVengiCalukya00089.xml">Set 2 </ref> correspond to No. 14. However, according to the same report, the seal of No. 15 has a preserved lotus flower, while that of No. 14 does not. This is the opposite of the above, as a lotus flower is visible only on the seal of Set 2. A Devanagari transcript of Set 1 in the ASI headquarters in Mysore bears the title <q>CP No XV of 1916-17</q>, where “XV” has been corrected from “XIV”. The post-correction number is thus consistent with how the contents of the plates are reported, and thus I have equated Set 1 to No. 15 and Set 2 to No. 14. The fact that the transcript's title has been corrected indicates that there was already some confusion about the numbering of these sets in the ASI office. The discrepancy about the reported seals may be a mistake of the ARIE report, or the seals (with the ring now cut) may have been swapped between the sets.</p>
<p>Although many of the early grants of the Eastern Cālukya dynasty are poorly composed and executed, the quality of this charter makes me suspect forgery. The plates may have been engraved more or less at the time they were supposed to be issued, but possibly by a forger who used one or more genuine grants as specimens to cobble together the present one. The use of <foreign>anusvāra</foreign>, <foreign>visarga</foreign>, final <foreign>M</foreign> characters and punctuation marks is entirely inconsistent (see also the palaeographic description); in fact, what look like (and are shown in my edition as) <foreign>visarga</foreign>s seem to function as punctuation marks and may have been intended as such. In addition, the following items are worth noting:
<list>
<item>in l1, <foreign>sakala-bhuvana-jagad-abhiṣṭūyamāna</foreign> is an unlikely variant: while the forms <foreign>-bhuvana-saṁstūyamāna</foreign> and <foreign>-jagad-abhiṣṭūyamāna</foreign> both occur in related charters, the combination does not (though the corrupt form <foreign>jagadasaṁstuyamāna</foreign> is found in the <ref target="DHARMA_INSVengiCalukya00060.xml">Cendaṟa grant of Jayasiṁha II</ref>);</item>
<item>in l3, <foreign>nārāyaṇa-vara-prasāda</foreign> is a conflation of <foreign>nārāyaṇa-prasāda</foreign> with <foreign>kauśikī-vara-prasāda</foreign> (this form is shared with the <ref target="DHARMA_INSVengiCalukya00089.xml">Pamiḍimukkala plates (set 2) of Viṣṇuvardhana II</ref>);</item>
<item>the composition of the opening <foreign>praśasti</foreign> resembles slightly later charters such as the <ref target="DHARMA_INSVengiCalukya00014.xml">Nutulapaṟu grant of Maṅgi Yuvarāja</ref> more closely than the other known grants of Viṣṇuvardhana II;</item>
<item>all Viṣṇuvardhana II’s known grants begin their genealogy with Viṣṇuvardhana I or further back (to the Bādāmi line), while the present genealogy commences with Jayasiṁha I (which is typical in grants of Maṅgi Yuvarāja);</item>
<item>the issuing king is not clearly introduced: if he is supposed to be a son or descendant of Viṣṇuvardhana II, then he is omitted altogether, while if he is supposed to be Viṣṇuvardhana II himself, then all the adjectives qualifying him are wrongly in the genitive (which would be appropriate in a grant of Maṅgi Yuvarāja, where Viṣṇuvardhana II would be introduced as the reigning king’s father), and he is not identified by any name other than Pralayāditya;</item>
<item>the formula in which the king notifies the residents is absent, which is very unusual in the corpus, although parallels do exist, including the <ref target="DHARMA_INSVengiCalukya00013.xml">Koṇeki grant of Viṣṇuvardhana II</ref>.</item>
<item>in l11, after the issuing ruler’s abrupt and/or incomplete introduction, the village name <foreign>upubr̥ṁh</foreign> is beyond unlikely;</item>
<item>exact parallels of stanza 4 occur in the known corpus only in the grants of Vijayāditya I, while variants of this stanza occur in those of Viṣṇuvardhana II (<ref target="DHARMA_INSVengiCalukya00096.xml">Peddāpurappāḍu plates (set 3) of Viṣṇuvardhana II</ref>), Vijayāditya I and Maṅgi Yuvarāja;</item>
<item>the colophon formula <foreign>ājñaptir asya dharmmasya</foreign> (with or without a complete <foreign>anuṣṭubh</foreign> stanza) does not occur in the known corpus before the time of Vijayāditya I.</item>
<item>the end of the colophon is garbled.</item>
</list></p>
<p>If the plates are assumed to be genuine, then the identity of their issuer is still doubtful. Either this is a grant of Viṣṇuvardhana II, in which case it is quite anomalous; or it is by a subsequent king, in which case it contains a major omission. Provided that the grant is genuine but not one of Viṣṇuvardhana II, the issuer is unlikely to be Maṅgi Yuvarāja, whose seal legend is Vijayasiddhi, but it could conceivably belong to Viṣṇuvardhana III who also used both the epithet Pralayāditya and the seal legend Viṣamasiddhi.</p>
