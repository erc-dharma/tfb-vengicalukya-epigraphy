                    <p>Halantas. Final M is a very small circle at headline height with a sinuous tail. Its circle part is barely or not at all larger than an anusvāra, but the latter is normally a solid circle (except e.g. l5 viṁśati), while final M is an outline. Padmanabha Sastry's edition reads all final M-s as anusvāras; this is not indicated in my apparatus. Final N may be the same size as the regular na, but with no headmark and a slightly sinuous stem (e.g. l5 vatsarāN). Or it may be a reduced and raised form (e.g. l7 māsāN). Final T is a full-sized ta with a sinuous tail instead of a headmark.</p>
                    <p>Original punctuation marks are straight vertical bars with a nail head at the top.
                      The opening symbol is a flower with a central circle and eight petals, each shaped like a letter S or a Devanagari numeral 9 (the two facing W and SW are mirror images of the other 6).</p>
                    <p>Other palaeographic observations. Long ī is written in two forms, one with curl inside the circle, e.g. l1 śrīmatāṁ, and one with a dot inside the circle, e.g. l1 hārītī. There is no clear distinction between dependent o and au, which have been read as applicable to the context. (However, dependent o may also be composed of two separate strokes at top right and bottom left, e.g. l9 ākhyo.)

        <note>The ASI transcript <foreign>tamma bhimākhyaṁ</foreign> corrected to <foreign>tammu bhīmākhya</foreign> (or perhaps the corrector wished to emphasise, rather than delete, the final <foreign>anusvāra</foreign>?). PS's emendation to <foreign>tam</foreign> is unmetrical and can be ruled out. The sign after <foreign>ākhya</foreign> definitely involves a second dot in addition to the one placed at head height. The lower dot is, however, smaller, does not appear to be as deeply incised, and takes up no horizontal space, being located to the left of the upper dot rather than straight below it. An originally engraved <foreign>anusvāra</foreign> may have been corrected to <foreign>visarga</foreign>. The parallel locus in the <ref target="DHARMA_INSVengiCalukya00076.xml">Single Bhimavaram plate of a late Eastern Cālukya king</ref> definitely has a <foreign>visarga</foreign>, but that too is probably a subsequent insertion.

PS, in his discussion of this text, says she was a Kaliṅga Gaṅga princess, but this seems unlikely to me. It is in principle possible to read the entire stanza as a compound where the might of Meḻabāmbā would be revered by the Gaṅgas, but I find this implausible (and it would still not explicitly mean that she was a princess of that family) and think that the text up to <foreign>-maho</foreign> applies to Bhīma II.</note></p>

<div type="commentary">
<p>Many stanzas of the royal <foreign>praśasti</foreign> are attested several times in the grants of Amma II, but not before him. The same is true of some of the prose <foreign>praśasti</foreign> at the beginning of the executive section. The writer Jontācārya is also featured in several grants of Amma II as well as Dānārṇava. It is possible that Jontācārya first rose to prominence in the chancellery late in the reign of Bhīma II and composed these stanzas and phrases (or inserted them into the standard template) originally with reference to Bhīma, then repurposed them to describe Amma II. The phrase <foreign>mānonnato natoddhata-sarvva-lokaḥ sarvva-lokāśraya</foreign> seems to imply this, as Amma II’s <foreign>āśraya</foreign> epither is <foreign>samasta-bhuvanāśraya</foreign>, which is rather awkwardly omitted or distorted from the parallel titulature in his grants (00035 Elavaṟṟu grant of Amma II:  <foreign>mānonnato natoddhata-samasta-lokaḥ samasta-bhuvanāśraya</foreign>; 00045 Tāṇḍikoṇḍa grant of Amma II: <foreign>mānonnato natoddhatas samasta-bhuvanāśraya</foreign>; 00046 Vandram plates of Amma II : <foreign>mānonnatoddhataḥ samasta-lokaḥ samasta-bhuvanāśraya</foreign>). However, stanza VI of this charter describes the reign of Bhīma II, and also states its length in several later grants.<note><ref target="DHARMA_INSVengiCalukya00041.xml">Nāgiyapūṇḍi grant of Amma II</ref>, <ref target="DHARMA_INSVengiCalukya00043.xml">Paḷaṁkalūru grant of Amma II</ref>, <ref target="DHARMA_INSVengiCalukya00044.xml">Pāṁbaṟṟu grant of Amma II</ref>, <ref target="DHARMA_INSVengiCalukya00045.xml">Tāṇḍikoṇḍa grant of Amma II</ref>, <ref target="DHARMA_INSVengiCalukya00071.xml">Kaṇḍyam plates of Dānārṇava</ref>, <ref target="DHARMA_INSVengiCalukya00074.xml">Masulipatam incomplete plates of Amma II</ref>.</note> Here, the part about his reign’s duration is omitted, which renders the verse grossly defective both in metre (lacking 11 syllables) and in syntax (lacking a verb and an object to that verb to parallel <foreign>nākam</foreign>). This does not seem to be accidental and may rather suggest that the charter was written during the reign of Amma II or Dānārṇava, and predated for some reason to the time of Bhīma II. (The <ref target="DHARMA_INSVengiCalukya00087.xml">Pulivaṟṟu (spurious?) grant of Amma I</ref> is a similar case, also hallmarked by Jontācārya.) The plates, however, have all appearance of proper royal charters, so if they are spurious, they were nonetheless in all likelihood engraved in the royal chancellery. Since several small details fit the notion that the grant does indeed belong to Bhīma II, the most likely explanation of the anomalies is that the grant had been made by Bhīma II, but the official copper plates were only issued during the reign of one of his successors, most likely Amma II.</p>
<p>The closely connected stanza V is unique in the corpus aside from a partial attestation in the incomplete <ref target="DHARMA_INSVengiCalukya00076.xml">Single Bhimavaram plate of a late Eastern Cālukya king</ref>. Due to inconsistent case endings, the syntax of this stanza is not clear. What one would expect at this point in the narrative is an introduction of Yuddhamalla as the next king after Vikramāditya II. However, reading V as such an introduction not only requires a minor emendation (<foreign>yuddhamallādhipaṁ</foreign> to <foreign>yuddhamallādhipaḥ</foreign>) but also faces a major difficulty: the word <foreign>rakṣanta</foreign> must then somehow be a verb in the third person singular. I see no way to emend it appropriately and preserve the metre. The only plausible way of dealing with <foreign>rakṣanta</foreign> that I can conceive of is to emend it to <foreign>rakṣantaṁ</foreign>, in which case it stands in apposition to <foreign>yuddhamallādhipaṁ</foreign> in the accusative. This, however, leaves stanza V bereft of a finite verb  (and possibly of a subject too, see below). I think it is acceptable to find this in the following stanza. That, in turn, has only a pronoun for an object of the absolutives in the first quarter, whose signification must be supplied from the preceding prose in the other attestations of this stanza, and from V in the present context. Read in this way, we do have the expected narrative where Yuddhamalla (II) rules Veṅgī for seven years, and is ousted by Bhīma II. The only deviation from the standard king list is that Yuddhamalla is not presented as a proper member of that list, but rather as a parenthetical item who had to be disposed of—which would be understandable in a charter of Bhīma II even if other charters of the same ruler do recognise Yuddhamalla as a legitimate predecessor.</p>
<p>I am thus quite certain that I interpret V and VI correctly in this respect. The first hemistich of V, however, remains to be understood. It refers, beyond reasonable doubt, to a person named Tammu-Bhīma. The second glyph in this name has been read as <foreign>mma</foreign> by Padmanabha Sastry, as well as by Subba Rao in his edition of the <ref target="DHARMA_INSVengiCalukya00076.xml">Single Bhimavaram plate of a late Eastern Cālukya king</ref>, but the glyph (both here and in the other instance) clearly sports an extra “ear” attached to the subscript <foreign>m</foreign> on the right-hand side. This stroke looks like it could be the right wing of the subscript <foreign>m</foreign>, but it does not occur in any glyph for <foreign>mma</foreign> that I am aware of (cf. e.g. l15), while being identical to the form of dependent <foreign>u</foreign> associated with certain consonants with a rounded bottom (cf. in particular <foreign>dyu</foreign> in l26). The glyph was also read as <foreign>mmu</foreign> by the person who made corrections in red in the ASI transcript. Tammu-Bhīma is thus quite certain, but this name is not attested anywhere else that I know of. The name may be either in the accusative or the nominative in the present charter (see the apparatus to line 17), and both can be interpreted sensibly in the context. Given the parallel locus, I consider the nominative more likely and translate accordingly. If the word <foreign>tammu</foreign> is connected to Telugu <foreign>tammuḍu</foreign> “younger brother”, then this name (in the nominative) might well denote Bhīma II, the younger brother of Amma I. If, however, the accusative is correct, then Tammu-Bhīma may be an otherwise unknown epithet of Yuddhamalla II, or it may refer to a third person whom Yuddhamalla had killed in order to establish his own reign of seven years. The use of a name plus <foreign>ākhya</foreign> as a substantive (rather than adjective) has parallels elsewhere in the corpus (e.g. <ref target="DHARMA_INSVengiCalukya00033.xml">Kolaveṇṇu plates of Bhīma II</ref>, stanza III; <ref target="DHARMA_INSVengiCalukya00040.xml">Pedda-Gāḻidipaṟṟu grant of Amma II</ref>, stanza V). Subba Rao in his edition of the <ref target="DHARMA_INSVengiCalukya00076.xml">Single Bhimavaram plate of a late Eastern Cālukya king</ref> sees this as a reference to Bhīma III, a putative son of Amma I, and the same may have occurred to the person who wrote the ASI transcript of the present plates, who pencilled “Amba’s[?] son” here, with a reference to Fleet’s edition of the <ref target="DHARMA_INSVengiCalukya00032.xml">Diggubaṟṟu grant of Bhīma II</ref> where the existence of Bhīma III is proposed. While such a son might also plausibly bear an epithet meaning “younger brother Bhīma”, I see no evidence anywhere that Amma I had a child named Bhīma (to be discussed elsewhere; see also my edition of the <ref target="DHARMA_INSVengiCalukya00032.xml">Diggubaṟṟu grant of Bhīma II</ref>). Also, since Amma I’s certain child, Vijayāditya V, is consistently described as being of a tender age when he was displaced by Yuddhamalla (e.g. <foreign>arbhaka</foreign> in the present grant), it is very unlikely that a younger brother of that child would have been slain in battle at much the same time. If Tammu-Bhīma is someone whom Yuddhamalla killed, then it is most likely Vikramāditya II, who was also the younger brother of a previously reigning king.</p>
<p>For stanza XIV, both the ASI transcript and Padmanabha Sastry’s edition <bibl rend="omitname"><ptr target="bib:PadmanabhaSastry1990_01"/><citedRange unit="page">65</citedRange></bibl> comment that Revakāmbā “married into Paṭṭavardhana family” or “married a person belonging to the Paṭṭavardhinī family” (respectively). The text, however, says unequivocally that Revakāmbā was herself the head of the Paṭṭavardhana family. Given the indications in other grants that there was a strong matrilineal tradition in this family, I am certain it is mistaken to posit that she gained membership in that family through marriage.</p>
