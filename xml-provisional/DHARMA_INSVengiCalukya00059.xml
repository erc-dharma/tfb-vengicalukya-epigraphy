        <note>The phrase ending here is probably to be restored as <foreign>hāritī-putrāṇāṁ</foreign>, but <foreign>mānavya-sagotrāṇāṁ</foreign> is also possible. The latter phrase usually precedes the former (not always immediately), but may occasionally come second.

        <note>Jayasiṁha I's grandfather was Kīrtīvarman, whose name, however, takes the standard genitive <foreign>kīrttīvarmaṇaḥ</foreign> in all cognate plates where he is mentioned. Together with the end of this line (see the next note), it seems possible that <foreign>naptr̥</foreign> was used here in the sense of "great-grandson", and the person mentioned at the end of line 3 was Pulikeśin I Raṇavikrama.</note>

        <note>Although <foreign>pu</foreign> is partly lost at the broken edge, the reading is quite unambiguous. It suggests the continuation <foreign>vipula-kīrtteḥ kīrttivarmaṇaḥ</foreign> (as in the <ref target="DHARMA_INSVengiCalukya00003.xml">Timmapuram plates of Viṣṇuvardhana I</ref>), followed by a word meaning "grandson". However, this restoration leaves little room for text expected before the extant beginning of the next line (e.g. <foreign>śakti-traya-vaśīkr̥ta-sakala-mahī</foreign>, from the <ref target="DHARMA_INSVengiCalukya00013.xml">Koṇeki grant of Viṣṇuvardhana II</ref>). A shorter phrase of similar purport may have been used, e.g. <foreign>vaśīkr̥ta-mahī</foreign>. Alternatively, reading <foreign>viṣṇu</foreign> here is not impossible, but less likely than <foreign>vipu</foreign>. In this case, the introduction of Viṣṇuvardhana would presumably begin here (and the genealogy would then start with Kīrtīvarman contrary to the previous note), but I am not familiar with a description of Viṣṇuvardhana I beginning with the word <foreign>viṣṇu</foreign>.</note>

        <note>I agree with NR that the title <foreign>sarvasiddhi</foreign> was used here. However, this title of Jayasiṁha I is never, as far as I am aware, explained with <foreign>apratihata-śaktitva</foreign>. That term is frequently used in cognate grants, but always in the form <foreign>X iva apratihata-śaktiḥ</foreign>.</note>

        <note>Scribal omission is also possible here; the composer's intent may have been <foreign>nimitteneyam</foreign>.

        <note>My reading of the end of line 19 is quite certain in spite of damage. It is, however, conceivable that the character which looks like <foreign>su</foreign> is a very badly drawn <foreign>jña</foreign>. I am far less certain about the first character in line 20. Here, NR probably intended to show in his edition a conjunct with a subscript <foreign>ḍ</foreign> and an <foreign>i</foreign> marker. The upper part of this glyph does not, however, resemble any <foreign>i</foreign> (or <foreign>ī</foreign>) in the inscription, and is also much larger than the lower component, implying that it is the body belonging to a subscript consonant rather than a superscript vowel marker. Although its inner part differs from instances of <foreign>l</foreign> in the inscription, its shape is a plausible <foreign>l</foreign> for the time and region, and if it is indeed <foreign>l</foreign>, then no vowel marker is attached. The subscript part does look rather like <foreign>ḍ</foreign>, but taking it for a <foreign>v</foreign> is the only way I can extract some sense from the text. Alternatively, this character may perhaps be a thoroughly botched <foreign>pte</foreign> (or <foreign>pti</foreign>), so that assuming a likewise botched <foreign>jña</foreign> in the previous line and a few smaller scribal errors, the intent may have been <foreign>svamukhājñapti</foreign>, although I cannot explain why another person would then be named as <foreign>āṇati</foreign>. The name of this latter executor (or the end of his name) may perhaps be <foreign>buṁggi</foreign> with an <foreign>anusvāra</foreign> within the <foreign>i mātrā</foreign>, and the text read as <foreign>sulva</foreign> may belong to this name.</note>

<div type="commentary">
<p>According to Ramesan’s discussion, the grant was made <q>in the presence of the Queen Triloka Mahādevī</q>. I know of no such queen, and even NR seems not to trust his own interpretation, since according to his introduction, the grant does not contain <q>any new unknown or additional information about the Eastern Cālukyan chronology or genealogy</q>. The reading of the last two lines has some uncertainties (see the apparatus) and is not fully intelligible. Since <foreign>trailokya-vikrama</foreign> is one of Jayasiṁha I’s epithets, it is at least possible that he is indicated by the name Traloka Mahādevuḷa. If I read the word <foreign>sulva</foreign> correctly and this was intended to mean <foreign>śulva</foreign>, then this clause probably means that the plot was measured in the presence of the king himself.</p>
