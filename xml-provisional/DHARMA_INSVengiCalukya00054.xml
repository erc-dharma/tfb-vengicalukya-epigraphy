                    <p>Original punctuation marks</p>
  <p>Other palaeographic observations. The consonants ka and ra occur in both short and long forms. Anusvāra is usually above the character to which it belongs, but often to the right of that consonant and occasionally atop the next character (the only clear example of this is l22, ṃjalir, but it probably occurs at least a few more times, including the two probable occurrences of the name maṃgi). Dependent i and ī are rarely distinguished and are read as expected where there is no clear indication of either. See also the commentary.

At this stage, you can mention here in a free-text paragraph any characteristics of the writing observed more than once in this inscription that seem unusual/uncommon or otherwise noteworthy given the general characteristics of the script in question.

<handNote xml:id="DHARMA_INSVengiCalukya00053_hand1">The primary hand inscribing most of the text. Tends to be rather bold, using fairly simple and slightly cursive glyph forms.</handNote>
<handNote xml:id="DHARMA_INSVengiCalukya00053_hand2">I cannot assert definitively that this is a different hand, but line 37 certainly includes a higher number of awkward characters than the rest of the text. In addition, the dependent vowel <foreign>i</foreign> may be formed differently here than elsewhere, and most importantly, the consonants <foreign>b</foreign> and especially <foreign>y</foreign> are drawn rather differently. My impression is that this is a less confident hand, which attempts to draw sophisticated characters with a varying degree of success, unlike the primary hand that simplifies boldly and confidently.</handNote>

In addition to this character, there seems to be something added below the line at this point, just to the right of the descender of <foreign>ra</foreign>. The strokes visible there are probably not random damage, since the next line bends out of its way below them, so that the string <foreign>ṇḍalasya</foreign> in that line is slightly lowered and inclined downward, while the following <foreign>śrī</foreign> is at a much higher level. However, no insertion seems to be required either here or in the next line at this point. I cannot read the inserted text, if that is what it is. Its first character may be a small <foreign>ṇa</foreign>, and this may be followed by one to three further small characters of whose shape nothing can be discerned in the estampage.</note>

        <note>The characters <foreign>taya</foreign> are at the lower edge of the binding hole, and are therefore reduced in size and slightly distorted in shape. I cannot fully reconstruct RM's reading and emendation. At the end of line 4, he apparently reads <foreign>jayaśilati</foreign> and emends the final vowel to <foreign>ā</foreign>. A footnote by his editor completes this emendation to <foreign>jayāsi-latā</foreign>. In line 5 it is also clear that RM emends <foreign>śū</foreign> to <foreign>sū</foreign>, but I fail to understand what he intends with the word <foreign>praroha</foreign>, shown in his edition in round parentheses. He probably means this to replace the preceding word he reads as <foreign>praśūtāya</foreign>, but if so, then I do not see why he first emends that to <foreign>prasūtāya</foreign>. No matter what RM intended, I am confident that the composer's intent was in line with my emendation, based on lines 10-11 of the <ref target="DHARMA_INSVengiCalukya00013.xml">Koṇeki grant of Viṣṇuvardhana II</ref>, which describe Jayasiṁha I as <foreign>°āneka-samara-saṁghaṭṭa-labdha-vijaya-śīlatā-prasūta-yaśaḥ-prasūtāmoda-gandhādhivāsita-sakala-dig-maṇḍalasya</foreign> (where <foreign>-prasūtāmoda-</foreign> is probably erroneous for <foreign>-prasūty-āmoda-</foreign>).</note>

There is a slight possibility that the first <foreign>bhuja</foreign> is in fact a different word beginning with <foreign>bhu</foreign>, and thus the second is not redundant. It is also possible that the second <foreign>bhuja</foreign> is not simply a product of dittography, but an erroneously engraved word influenced by the first <foreign>bhuja</foreign>.

        <note>I accept RM's reading, which he prints as clear. In fact, the last character of the name is far from clear. If an <foreign>anusvāra</foreign> is present, then it seems to be placed in the middle of the circular vowel mark for <foreign>i</foreign>. The vowel could equally well be read as <foreign>ī</foreign>. Between <foreign>ma</foreign> and the putative <foreign>ṁgi</foreign>, there is a distinct vertical stroke, as high as a character body. The body of the final character is unclear; reading it as <foreign>g</foreign> is possible, but if it was meant to be <foreign>g</foreign>, then it has probably been corrected from something else. Possibly, <foreign>maghiṁ</foreign> (for <foreign>maṁghi</foreign>) was first inscribed; compare line 20 of the <ref target="DHARMA_INSVengiCalukya00016.xml">Jaḷayūru grant of Viṣṇuvardhana III</ref>. Alternatively, this character may have started out as <foreign>śrī</foreign> or <foreign>chrī</foreign> (for <foreign>śrīmac-chrī</foreign>), in which case part of its subscript <foreign>r</foreign> may have been incorporated into the vowel <foreign>i</foreign> of <foreign>sarvvān ittham</foreign> below (another part being the vertical line visible after <foreign>ma</foreign>). Yet another alternative is that <foreign>ge</foreign> or <foreign>go</foreign> was first inscribed.</note>

        <note>In line 11, the character read as <foreign>vi</foreign> could well be <foreign>ni</foreign>, possibly <foreign>bhi</foreign>, and the one read as <foreign>sa</foreign> could be just about anything on the basis of the estampage. The final consonant could also be <foreign>v</foreign> instead of <foreign>n</foreign>, and no <foreign>e</foreign> marker is discernible in the estampage. RM seems to take all of this string as a topnym in the locative, but he does not discuss it at all in his introduction. An editorial footnote interpets this as <q>the camping place</q>, presumably of Maṅgi Yuvarāja, and identifies it as the village Maṇḍūru near the modern village Mopaṟṟu. Given the convincing identification, I accept the reading, but retain a degree of doubt. The second character in line 12 is a complex and strange conjunct that looks most like <foreign>ñcū</foreign>. Compare the very differently shaped <foreign>ṇḍa</foreign> further on in this line, and the very similar <foreign>ñca</foreign> in line 15. It is preceded by a conspicuous dot that I take to be an <foreign>anusvāra</foreign>. The following character lacks a cross-stroke, so it may be <foreign>ḻū</foreign> rather than <foreign>ṟū</foreign>. Moreover, given its flat top, <foreign>dhū</foreign> is also possible. Compare <foreign>dha</foreign> in line 13 which, though slightly damaged, looks very similar. I see no indication of an <foreign>e</foreign> attached to the following <foreign>r</foreign>, nor any damage where I would expect one to be.</note>

<div type="commentary">
<p>The text ends abruptly with the last line on 3r. I agree with RM that only a very small amount of text seems to be lost here, identifying the writer of the text. RM believes a date was also lost here, but I do not find this likely on the basis of parallel grants. It is not clear whether the last bit of text in line 26 is prose or a garbled continuation of the <foreign>indravajrā</foreign> hemistich identifying the executor. The intended text may for instance have been something like <foreign>tac-chāsanasyāsya ca lekha-karttā</foreign>. No information is available about the verso of plate 3, but it seems most likely that the remaining text was engraved there; it may be so worn that an estampage was not made.</p>
<p>The issuer of these plates was identified in the ARIE report as Jayasiṁha I on the grounds that the seal bears the legend <foreign>sarvasiddhi</foreign> and only Kīrtivarman and Viṣṇuvardhana (I) are mentioned as ancestors in the genealogy. RM, however, asserts that <foreign>maṅgi-yuva-vallabha-mahārāja</foreign> is clearly the donor (though the published facsimile is not entirely clear, nor is <foreign>maṁgi-yuvarājaḥ</foreign> completely certain in line 12; see the apparatus to these lines), and adds that, since Maṅgi Yuvarāja’s seals have the legend <foreign>vijayasiddhi</foreign>, the seal may not be the original seal of this grant. He further supposes that reference to the closer ancestry of Maṅgi Yuvarāja were apparently <q>left out by oversight</q>. His editor in EI (probably K. G. Krishnan) adds in a footnote that there may have been <q>a mix up of two different plates at a distant time</q>. Moreover, RM notes that the donor’s epithet is <foreign>sakala-lokāśraya</foreign> in line 6, but says only that this <q>means the same</q> as Maṅgi Yuvarāja’s regular epithet <foreign>sarvalokāśraya</foreign>. However, the two epithets are not necessarily interchangeable. The question of the issuer needs further study.</p>
<p>Some details to consider are the following.
<list
><item>1, The phraseology of the grant has much in common with known grants of Maṅgi Yuvarāja. However, it has just as much in common with grants of Jayasiṁha I and Viṣṇuvardhana II. Particularly noteworthy is the fact that all grants of Maṅgi known to me begin with a more mature version of the stock text <foreign>śrīmatāṁ sakala-</foreign>.</item>
<item>2, The genealogy begins with Kīrtivarman, whereas grants of Maṅgi known to me begin either with Jayasiṁha I or with Kubja Viṣṇuvardhana. Genealogies beginning with Kīrtivarman are found in all grants of Jayasiṁha I that I know, one grant of Viṣṇuvardhana II (of the two I know), and the single known grant of Indra Bhaṭṭāraka.</item
><item>3, The exhortatory verses are unusual. Stanza 3 does not occur in any Eastern Cālukya grant I know of. Variants of stanza 4 occur (sporadically) only from the time of Vijayāditya I onward (00018), and the first closely related variant is in a grant of Kali Viṣṇuvardhana (00022). Stanza 6 occurs in at least one grant of Pulakeśin II, but among Eastern Cālukya charters, its only occurrence that I know of is in one of Bhīma I (00024).</item>
<item>4, I have not verified this, but the elaborate headmarks of this inscription (usually long horizontal lines with the ends curved up) seem late to me. It may be that a later scribe was attempting to imitate an earlier style of writing. A more detailed study of the palaeography is warranted.</item></list></p>
<p>The idea that plates belonging to different grants have been mixed up strikes me as preposterous, since the page breaks concerned would have had to be at the same spot in the text. The idea that Indra Bhaṭṭāraka and Viṣṇuvardhana II were omitted out of oversight is likewise preposterous; moreover, the text progresses smoothly through <foreign>kīrttivarmmaṇaḥ sūnor … śrī-viṣṇuvarddhana-mahārājasya priya-tanayaḥ … śrī-maṁgi(?)-yuva-vallabha-mahārājaḥ</foreign>. Any omitted people would have had to have been included in the draft before <foreign>priya-tanayaḥ</foreign>, and the syntax would have been quite awkward. Forgery (produced some generations after Maṅgi Yuvarāja and probably using a genuine seal) seems quite likely, but I would expect a forger to have copied a specimen grant with alteration only in the executive section, rather than cobbling the text together from grants of different rulers.</p>
<p>The possibility also remains that it is an idiosyncratic charter of the Maṅgi Yuvarāja we are familiar with. And there is, in addition, some chance that we are dealing here with an unknown Maṅgi Yuvarāja from an earlier time. This person could be either Jayasiṁha I before his formal accession to the throne, or Indra Bhaṭṭāraka. The former did use the epithet <foreign>sakala-lokāśraya</foreign>, and if the problematic locus in line 8 correctly reads <foreign>śrīmachrī</foreign> instead of <foreign>śrīmaṁgi</foreign>, then “the majestic <foreign>yuvarāja</foreign>, son of Viṣṇuvardhana” would clearly identify him. The latter, in turn, may well have spent part (perhaps a large part) of his life as <foreign>yuvarāja</foreign> under Jayasiṁha I. Although he is not known to have been called <foreign>sakala-lokāśraya</foreign>, if his personal name had been Maṅgi and if <foreign>yuvarāja</foreign> had stuck to him as a permanent epithet, then that would to some degree explain why his grandson bore the name Maṅgi Yuvarāja as a crowned king.
