        <note>According to RM's note, <foreign>ra</foreign> <q>looks like <foreign>ru</foreign>. However, the <foreign>ū</foreign> sign is curved upwards.</q> In fact, evidently <foreign>saṁ</foreign> was first engraved, then corrected to <foreign>ra</foreign>. In addition to this character, there seems to be something added below the line at this point, just to the right of the descender of <foreign>ra</foreign>. The strokes visible there are probably not random damage, since the next line bends out of its way below them, so that the string <foreign>ṇḍalasya</foreign> in that line is slightly lowered and inclined downward, while the following <foreign>śrī</foreign> is at a much higher level. However, no insertion seems to be required either here or in the next line at this point. I cannot read the inserted text, if that is what it is. Its first character may be a small <foreign>ṇa</foreign>, and this may be followed by one to three further small characters of whose shape nothing can be discerned in the estampage.</note>

        <note>I cannot fully reconstruct RM's reading and emendation. At the end of line 4, he apparently reads <foreign>jayaśilati</foreign> and emends the final vowel to <foreign>ā</foreign>. A footnote by his editor completes this emendation to <foreign>jayāsi-latā</foreign>. In line 5 it is also clear that RM emends <foreign>śū</foreign> to <foreign>sū</foreign>, but I fail to understand what he intends with the word <foreign>praroha</foreign>, shown in his edition in round parentheses. He probably means this to replace the preceding word he reads as <foreign>praśūtāya</foreign>, but if so, then I do not see why he first emends that to <foreign>prasūtāya</foreign>. No matter what RM intended, I am quite confident that he is mistaken. The first characters in line 5 are in my opinion not <foreign>praśūtāya</foreign> but <foreign>praśūtāmo</foreign>. Of this sequence, <foreign>tāmo</foreign> are at the lower edge of the binding hole, and are therefore reduced in size and distorted in shape. The scribe had thus clearly started to engrave <foreign>prasūtāmoda</foreign> at the edge of the plate, but then he saw that it looked awkward and noticed the mistake in <foreign>śū</foreign>, and re-engraved these characters. There is no visible indication that the first four characters are deleted, but this was nevertheless certainly the engraver's intent. As for line 4, <foreign>jayāsi-latā</foreign> is quite ingenuous and some later Eastern Cālukya inscriptions do routinely compare swords to lianas. However, the <ref target="DHARMA_INSVengiCalukya00013.xml">Koṇeki grant of Viṣṇuvardhana II</ref> (lines 10-11) describes Jayasiṁha I as <foreign>°āneka-samara-saṁghaṭṭa-labdha-vijaya-śīlatā-prasūta-yaśaḥ-prasūtāmoda-gandhādhivāsita-sakala-dig-maṇḍalasya</foreign> (where <foreign>-prasūtāmoda-</foreign> is probably erroneous for <foreign>-prasūty-āmoda-</foreign>), so the reading <foreign>jaya-śīlatā</foreign> can be established confidently here.</note>

        <lem>-bhu<unclear cert="low">ja</unclear><surplus>bhu<unclear>ja</unclear></surplus>-</lem>
        <note>I follow RM in dismissing the second <foreign>bhuja</foreign> as superfluous dittography. There is a slight possibility that the first <foreign>bhuja</foreign> is in fact a different word beginning with <foreign>bhu</foreign>, and thus the second is not redundant. It is also possible that the second <foreign>bhuja</foreign> is not simply a product of dittography, but an erroneously engraved word influenced by the first <foreign>bhuja</foreign>. The <ref target="DHARMA_INSVengiCalukya00013.xml">Koṇeki grant of Viṣṇuvardhana II</ref> has <foreign>sakala-lokāśraya-bhuja-yugaḷa-bala-namitāśeṣa-</foreign> (describing Jayasiṁha), and the composer's intent may have been <foreign>-bhuja-yuga-</foreign> here.</note>

        <lem>śrī-ma<unclear cert="low">ṁgi</unclear>-</lem>
        <note>I accept RM's reading, which he prints as clear. In fact, the last character of the name is far from clear. If an <foreign>anusvāra</foreign> is present, then it seems to be placed in the middle of the circular vowel mark for <foreign>i</foreign>. The vowel could equally well be read as <foreign>ī</foreign>. Between <foreign>ma</foreign> and the putative <foreign>ṁgi</foreign>, there is a distinct vertical stroke, as high as a character body. The body of the final character is unclear; reading it as <foreign>g</foreign> is possible, but if it was meant to be <foreign>g</foreign>, then it has probably been corrected from something else. Possibly, <foreign>maghiṁ</foreign> (for <foreign>maṁghi</foreign>) was first inscribed; compare line 20 of the <ref target="DHARMA_INSVengiCalukya00016.xml">Jaḷayūru grant of Viṣṇuvardhana III</ref>. Alternatively, this character may have started out as <foreign>śrī</foreign> or <foreign>chrī</foreign> (for <foreign>śrīmac-chrī</foreign>), in which case part of its subscript <foreign>r</foreign> may have been incorporated into the vowel <foreign>i</foreign> of <foreign>sarvvān ittham</foreign> below (another part being the vertical line visible after <foreign>ma</foreign>). Yet another alternative is that <foreign>ge</foreign> or <foreign>go</foreign> was first inscribed.</note>

        <note>The ARIE report says the granted village is in <foreign>canū<unclear>ṟpa</unclear>lli viṣaya</foreign>. I believe its author must have read the locative ending <foreign>pallyāṁ</foreign> like I do even though RM ignores (or his edition omits) what seems to be a rather definite <foreign>anusvāra</foreign> at the end. As for the second character, I see no indication of <foreign>u</foreign>, much less of <foreign>ū</foreign>, in the estampage, but accept the joint testimony of two scholars who have read something of the kind here. The upper part of the third character definitely looks like <foreign>ḻ</foreign>, but a damaged <foreign>ṟ</foreign> (as read in ARIE) is not out of the question; in addition, the character could be <foreign>ḫpa</foreign>.</note>

        <note>Although RM prints most of this text as clearly legible, the vestiges I can make out in the estampage do not confirm his reading, and though the syntax is garbled, I expect only one name here (see the note to the translation). I cannot definitively exclude RM's reading, but the first character of the sequence that I find illegible does not seem to be <foreign>śa</foreign>; the second could perhaps be <foreign>ma</foreign> or <foreign>vā</foreign>; and the last looks like <foreign>dra</foreign> or <foreign>vra</foreign>. The first somewhat legible character, for which I provisionally accept RM's <foreign>gi</foreign>, may also be <foreign>dhi</foreign>, <foreign>vi</foreign> or <foreign>śi</foreign>.</note>
