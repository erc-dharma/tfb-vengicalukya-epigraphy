                    <p>Halantas. Final T in l1 seems to be a slightly reduced ta with a headmark much like the regular one; it may also be an erroneous ta instead of T.</p>
                    <p>Original punctuation marks</p>
  <p>Other palaeographic observations. The consonants ka and ra occur in both short and long forms. Anusvāra is usually above the character to which it belongs, but often to the right of that consonant and occasionally atop the next character (e.g. l8 maṁgi; l9 kuṭiṁbinas; l11 vedāṁga; l22, ṁjalir). Dependent i and ī are rarely distinguished and are read as expected where there is no clear indication of either. See also the commentary.
                      <!-- The script name(s) will be inserted here at a later stage from the metadata spreasheet. At this stage, you can mention here in a free-text paragraph any characteristics of the writing observed more than once in this inscription that seem unusual/uncommon or otherwise noteworthy given the general characteristics of the script in question.

The strokes are quite conspicuous in the estampage, but not visible at all in the photos. No insertion seems to be required either here or in the next line at this point.

        <note>The characters <foreign>taya</foreign> are at the lower edge of the binding hole, and are therefore reduced in size and slightly distorted in shape. I cannot fully reconstruct RM's reading and emendation. At the end of line 4, he apparently reads <foreign>jayaśilati</foreign> and emends the final vowel to <foreign>ā</foreign>. A footnote by his editor completes this emendation to <foreign>jayāsi-latā</foreign>. In line 5 it is also clear that RM emends <foreign>śū</foreign> to <foreign>sū</foreign>, but I fail to understand what he intends with the word <foreign>praroha</foreign>, shown in his edition in round parentheses. He probably means this to replace the preceding word he reads as <foreign>praśūtāya</foreign>, but if so, then I do not see why he first emends that to <foreign>prasūtāya</foreign>. No matter what RM intended, we have a close parallel in lines 10-11 of the <ref target="DHARMA_INSVengiCalukya00013.xml">Koṇeki grant of Viṣṇuvardhana II</ref>, which describe Jayasiṁha I as <foreign>°āneka-samara-saṁghaṭṭa-labdha-vijaya-śīlatā-prasūta-yaśaḥ-prasūtāmoda-gandhādhivāsita-sakala-dig-maṇḍalasya</foreign> (where <foreign>-prasūtāmoda-</foreign> is probably erroneous for <foreign>-prasūty-āmoda-</foreign>). The phrase <foreign>jaya-śrī-latā</foreign> in place of <foreign>jaya-śīlatā</foreign> is unexpected, but the subscript <foreign>r</foreign> is unmistakeable in the photo even in its worn state. It is possible that all of <foreign>praśūtaya</foreign> at the beginning of line 5 was intended to be cancelled, in which case we are left with a more elegant compound involving <foreign>jaya-śrī-latā</foreign>; but the text is interpretable with the above minor emendations even if all characters are retained.</note>

        <note>Although RM prints most of this text as clearly legible, neither the estampage nor the photo confirms his reading. Though the syntax of the sentence is garbled, I expect only one name here (see the note to the translation). My own reading is largely conjectural, based on very faint and ambiguous vestiges. What I read as <foreign>va</foreign> looks in fact more like <foreign>vā</foreign> or <foreign>ma</foreign>. In the name, my tentatively read <foreign>Ā</foreign> (apparently ignored or read as a punctuation mark by RM) could, on its own, be <foreign>dra</foreign> or <foreign>vra</foreign>, and my tentative <foreign>ḍi</foreign> (RM's <foreign>gi</foreign>, which I find impossible) may also be <foreign>di</foreign> or <foreign>dhi</foreign>.</note>

        <note>I am unable to propose a meaningful reading here, and show what I deem to be the most likely reading on the basis of the vestiges. This is unlikely to be exactly what was inscribed on the plates, and an examination of the original may reveal some further clues. I cannot agree with RM's reading <foreign>maṇḍūṟūre</foreign> even though his editor in a footnote suggests that this is a toponym identifiable as the village Maṇḍūru near the modern village Mopaṟṟu, which he believes was <q>the camping place</q> (presumably of Maṅgi Yuvarāja). I note that, on Google Maps at least, that village's name is Manduru with a dental <foreign>d</foreign>. In line 11, what I and RM read as <foreign>A</foreign> us identifiable only by a large and curling tail; the body is fully effaced. In principle, almost any consonant with a subscript <foreign>r</foreign> is also conceivable. The second character is most likely to be <foreign>sti</foreign>, but a different subscript consonant is possible. Reading <foreign>smai</foreign> (for <foreign>Asmai</foreign>) is not entirely out of the question, although the vowel is unlikely to be anything other than <foreign>i</foreign>. The third character is almost certainly <foreign>śa</foreign>, discernible both in the estampage and the photo. What RM reads as an <foreign>i</foreign> marker is the subscript <foreign>m</foreign> of <foreign>śarmmaṇaḥ</foreign> in the previous line. After this, <foreign>ha</foreign> and <foreign>sa</foreign> are reasonably clear. The former could perhaps also be <foreign>ḷa</foreign>; the latter is badly worn, but not too ambiguous. At the end of the line, <foreign>na</foreign> might also be <foreign>va</foreign>. In line 12, the second character, which I read as <foreign>ñcū</foreign>, is definitely not <foreign>ṇḍa</foreign>: compare the very different <foreign>ṇḍa</foreign> further on in this line, and the very similar <foreign>ñca</foreign> in line 15. It is preceded by a conspicuous dot that may be an <foreign>anusvāra</foreign> or an irrelevant pit in the metal. The following character is somewhat distorted to fit in below the binding hole, and its upper part may be lost to wear at the edge of the hole. Assuming that it is fully preserved, its most likely reading is <foreign>dhū</foreign>, but <foreign>ḻū</foreign> is also possible. Compare <foreign>dha</foreign> in line 13 which, though slightly damaged, looks very similar. If the upper right part is lost to wear, then <foreign>thū</foreign> and <foreign>ṟū</foreign> are also conceivable. The upper part of the line's fourth character is definitely lost to the widening of the hole, but it seems to have had a crossbar, so <foreign>ka</foreign> is a more likely reading than <foreign>ra</foreign>. It is followed by another possible <foreign>anusvāra</foreign> that may also be meaningless damage, but since the next character is inscribed at some distance, an <foreign>anusvāra</foreign> is more likely.</note>

<div type="commentary">
<p>The text ends abruptly with the last line on 3r. I agree with RM that only a very small amount of text seems to be missing here, most probably identifying the writer of the text. RM believes a date was also lost here, but I do not find this likely on the basis of parallel grants. It is not clear whether the last bit of text in line 26 is prose or a garbled continuation of the <foreign>indravajrā</foreign> hemistich identifying the executor; nor is it clear whether Ghanarāśi and Bhānuśakti are two separate persons or only one. The intended text may for instance have been something like <foreign>tac-chāsanasyāsya ca lekha-karttā</foreign>. The photographs published by the National Museum include a picture of 3v, which bears no trace of writing there whatsoever. Perhaps the text was intended to be complete as it is. The last character, <foreign>li</foreign>, may have been intended as an abbreviation for <foreign>likhita</foreign>, and the symbol after it might be an abbreviation marker. Assuming that the second hemistich intended by the composer was shortened meaningfully by the scribe to fit the text on the plate, it seems most likely that Ghanarāśi was the executor and Bhānuśakti was the writer.</p>
<p>The issuer of these plates was identified in the ARIE report as Jayasiṁha I on the grounds that the seal bears the legend <foreign>sarvasiddhi</foreign> and only Kīrtivarman and Viṣṇuvardhana (I) are mentioned as ancestors in the genealogy. RM, however, asserts that <foreign>maṅgi-yuva-vallabha-mahārāja</foreign> is clearly the donor. While neither instance of the name <foreign>maṁgi</foreign> is entirely clear, the reading is indeed quite secure. RM adds that, since Maṅgi Yuvarāja’s seals have the legend <foreign>vijayasiddhi</foreign>, the seal may not be the original seal of this grant. He further supposes that reference to the closer ancestry of Maṅgi Yuvarāja was apparently <q>left out by oversight</q>, which I find preposterous. His editor in EI (probably K. G. Krishnan) adds in a footnote that there may have been <q>a mix up of two different plates at a distant time</q>, which is even more preposterous. Moreover, RM notes that the donor’s epithet is <foreign>sakala-lokāśraya</foreign> in line 6, but says only that this <q>means the same</q> as Maṅgi Yuvarāja’s regular epithet <foreign>sarvalokāśraya</foreign>. However, the two epithets are evidently not interchangeable. It is now known that Jayasiṁha II also used <foreign>sarvasiddhi</foreign> on his seals, but no other ruler of the dynasty did. The question of the issuer needs further study.</p>
<p>Some details to consider are the following.
<list>
<item>1, The phraseology of the grant has much in common with known grants of Maṅgi Yuvarāja. However, it has just as much in common with grants of Jayasiṁha I and Viṣṇuvardhana II, most especially with the <ref target="DHARMA_INSVengiCalukya00013.xml">Koṇeki grant of Viṣṇuvardhana II</ref>. Particularly noteworthy is the fact that all grants of Maṅgi known to me commence with a more mature version of the stock text <foreign>śrīmatāṁ sakala-</foreign>.</item>
<item>2, The genealogy begins with Kīrtivarman, whereas grants of Maṅgi known to me begin either with Jayasiṁha I or with Kubja Viṣṇuvardhana. Genealogies beginning with Kīrtivarman are found in practically all grants of Jayasiṁha I, the single known grant of Indra Bhaṭṭāraka, and one grant of Viṣṇuvardhana II (of the seven that I know).</item>
<item>2, The genealogy begins with Kīrtivarman, whereas grants of Maṅgi known to me begin either with Jayasiṁha I or with Kubja Viṣṇuvardhana. Genealogies beginning with Kīrtivarman are found in all grants of Jayasiṁha I that I know, one grant of Viṣṇuvardhana II (of the two I know), and the single known grant of Indra Bhaṭṭāraka.</item>
<item>3, The exhortatory verses are uncommon. The first five are identical (down to their details and their sequence) to those in the <ref target="DHARMA_INSVengiCalukya00097.xml">Pulgoṭlapaṁbuluru grant of Vijayāditya III</ref> and the <ref target="DHARMA_INSVengiCalukya00095.xml">Uṟuvuṭūru grant of Vijayāditya III</ref>, and each of the five (or a variant thereof) also occurs, not necessarily in the same order, in the <ref target="DHARMA_INSVengiCalukya00062.xml">Ciṁbuluru plates of Vijayāditya III</ref> (with the lines in a different sequence). Variants of stanza 4 occur sporadically in grants of Viṣṇuvardhana II and Vijayāditya I, but the first closely related variant is in <ref target="DHARMA_INSVengiCalukya00022.xml">a grant of Kali Viṣṇuvardhana</ref>, and its only exact parallels are in the above grants of Vijayāditya III. Stanza 6 is common in the grants of the Bādāmi Cālukyas, but in the Veṅgī corpus it is only paralleled in the <ref target="DHARMA_INSVengiCalukya00057.xml">Peddāpurappāḍu plates (set 2) of Viṣṇuvardhana II</ref> and the <ref target="DHARMA_INSVengiCalukya00024.xml">Bezvāḍa plates of Bhīma I</ref>. Variants of stanza VII occur sporadically in the corpus, but variants where the speaker is named Rāmadeva rather than Rāmabhadra only occur in grants of Vijayāditya III.</item>
<item>4, I have not verified this, but the elaborate headmarks of this inscription (usually long horizontal lines with the ends curved up) seem late to me. It may be that a later scribe was attempting to imitate an earlier style of writing, but 9th-century production without any attempt at a different writing style seems most likely. A more detailed study of the palaeography is warranted.</item>
</list>
</p>
<p>All in all, it seems likely that the plates were inscribed at a time several generations after Maṅgi Yuvarāja. Given the elegant execution of the writing and the plates’ overall similarity to those of Vijayāditya III, it is in my opinion likely that the present grant was legitimately produced in Vijayāditya III’s chancellery, and is probably a reissue of a damaged earlier grant.<note>Vijayāditya III also donated the adjacent village in his <ref target="DHARMA_INSVengiCalukya00097.xml">Pulgoṭlapaṁbuluru grant</ref>.</note> Given the presumably original seal and the archaic preamble, the original on which the text is based probably hailed from the time of Jayasiṁha I, whose genealogy is correctly presented and who is also known to have used the epithets <foreign>sakala-lokāśraya</foreign> and <foreign>trailokya-vikrama</foreign>, applied to the issuer in the present text. The name of Maṅgi Yuvarāja may have been inserted into the new text at the insistence of the owner of the earlier grant, but this insertion has rendered the genealogy inaccurate, and the repeated mention of Maṅgi in lines 11-12 is unintelligible. The exhortatory stanzas would have been added according to the custom of the day (there may have been none or much fewer in the original), and the mutilated colophon may be the best copy of a damaged original that the latter-day scribes could manage.</p>
<p>Another fanciful way to explain the inconsistencies would be to assume that the original grant on which this text is based was issued by Jayasiṁha I’s younger brother who subsequently reigned as Indra Bhaṭṭāraka. Although there is no evidence for this, his birth name may have been Maṅgi and he may have been his elder brother’s <foreign>yuvarāja</foreign>. If so, then <foreign>yuvarāja</foreign> may have stuck to him as a permanent epithet, explaining to some degree why his grandson bore the name Maṅgi Yuvarāja even as a crowned king.</p>
