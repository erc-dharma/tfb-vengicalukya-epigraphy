                    <p>Halantas. Final N (e.g. l8, l31) is a raised and reduced na-shape with a sinuous tail. Final M (e.g. l11, l25) is a raised circle with a sinuous tail. Final T looks like ta with sinuous tail instead of headmark (e.g. l6), or like a raised and reduced ta with a sinuous tail, almost identical in the unclear facsimile to final N and M (l44, l52).</p>
                    <p>Original punctuation marks are double verticals with a pronounced serif.</p>
                    <p>Other palaeographic observations. Anusvāra is normally at head height after the character to which it belongs. Initial Ī occurs in line 49. Some ā markers look identical to superscript rephas (e.g. in line 27, compare the vertically oriented but distinctly recognisable ā marker in l29 ekādaśa). There is also ambiguity in the shape of superscript rephas when combined with an ā marker, cases of which have been read with the benefit of doubt.
                      <!-- The script name(s) will be inserted here at a later stage from the metadata spreasheet. At this stage, you can mention here in a free-text paragraph any characteristics of the writing observed more than once in this inscription that seem unusual/uncommon or otherwise noteworthy given the general characteristics of the script in question.

        <note>KR's <foreign>a</foreign> at the end of this locus is probably a typo.

The last consonant in line 33 could conceivably be <foreign>ṣ</foreign>, <foreign>p</foreign> or <foreign>b</foreign> and its vowel could be just about anything, but none of these yield a more interpretable text.

        <note>In addition to heavy damage, scribal omission may well be present here. The broken-off end of line 36 could hardly have accommodated more than three characters, and the corroded beginning of line 37 is likely to have had 3, at most 4 before the passably preserved <foreign>ta</foreign>. The vestiges after <foreign>ta</foreign> suggest <foreign>simi</foreign> or <foreign>siri</foreign>, but both are metrically incorrect and uninterpretable.

        <note>I accept KR's reading of the epithet, but the last character is not recognisable. This segment, with the possible exception of the initial <foreign>śrī</foreign>, is engraved over partially deleted earlier text that I cannot restore. The character beneath <foreign>ja</foreign> was a conjunct with a superscript <foreign>repha</foreign>, possibly <foreign>rgga</foreign>.

        <note>The restoration proposed by KR is both metrically and syntactically inappropriate. My own restoration is offered as a possible one.

Both assumptions may be wrong (the metre may have been a <foreign>vallarī</foreign> like stanzas 19 and 20, with two fewer morae in the second hemistich), and some other words to a similar effect may have stood here. The situation is complicated by the presence of scribal correction, but none of the pre-correction text can be made out except for what looks like a subscript <foreign>ḍ</foreign> below the space between PC <foreign>mi</foreign> and <foreign>ra</foreign>; and a possible subscript <foreign>r</foreign> or the curved lower part of a different subscript consonant slightly to the right of PC <foreign>trā</foreign>.</note>

        <note>KR's editor (Sircar?) proposes emending this to <foreign>sphuṭataraṁ</foreign> for the sake of the metre.

This is indeed how RK summarises the stanza, but I see no way to finding that meaning in the text. The second hemistich is an awkward jumble of words. Most jarringly, it lacks a verbal form to express the action. Moreover, it uses surprisingly flattering terminology <supplied reason="explanation"><foreign>īśa</foreign> and <foreign>śrī</foreign></supplied> for the enemy Coḍa-Bhīma, and while <foreign>api</foreign> ought to imply a contradiction (“even though he had first cast down his enemies”), I see no such thing, nor any need for a reference to enemies in general here. Conversely, there is nothing in the second hemistich about Cālukya-Nārāyaṇa doing so in his own form, nor is there a counterpart here to <foreign>prāk</foreign>, “in olden days.” The only point where the second hemistich matches the first is that this human Nārāyaṇa defeats an enemy likened to Rāvaṇa, who was defeated by the divine Nārāyaṇa in the form of Rāma. The text on the plate is quite clearly legible and includes only one evident scribal mistake (<foreign>°āṣāsta</foreign>), where the composer’s original intent is quite straightforward (<foreign>°āpāsta</foreign>). I wonder if perhaps the fourth quarter belongs originally to a different stanza. Two stanzas may have been either cobbled together badly by a clumsy composer, or a quarter of the first and three quarters of the second may have been omitted by an inattentive scribe.</note></p>

<div type="commentary">
<p rend="stanza" n="3">KR, in my opinion, misunderstands this stanza in his discussion, stating first that Vijayāditya III chased Kannara and Śaṅkila into the impregnable country, but then adding in a note that this <q>impregnable country was evidently the kingdom of Baddega</q>. He may have done so on the assumption that his restoration <foreign>durggamān</foreign> (with sandhi for <foreign>durggamāt</foreign>) was a singular ablative qualifying <foreign>janapadāt</foreign>, but the much better preserved parallel version clearly reads <foreign>durggaman</foreign> (with sandhi for <foreign>durggamam</foreign>), which I find to be better in context, establishing a contrast between <foreign>janapada</foreign> and <foreign>durggama</foreign>.<note>The <ref target="DHARMA_INSVengiCalukya00071.xml">Kaṇḍyam plates of Dānārṇava</ref> reportedly also read <foreign>durggamān</foreign>. If this can be confirmed from a facsimile, then the same reading may also be acceptable here, but it should still be construed as a plural accusative (<foreign>durggamān</foreign> scil. <foreign>deśān</foreign>), not a singular ablative.</note> KR’s editor (probably Sircar) also thinks that the badlands are not identical to Baddega’s homeland. KR’s interpretation also states that Guṇaga Vijayāditya <q>protected Baddega from fear</q>. However, it can only be Vijayāditya himself who is described here as fearless.</p>
<p>Sandhi-obscured caesura in v12 (śārdūlavikrīḍita) c. The break between pādas c and d is obscured by sandhi in v22 (also śārdūlavikrīḍita).</p>
<p>The outer side of the last extant plate is heavily corroded and in many places illegible or barely legible. With the photos of the original, I have been able to provide a reading for most of it. Text shown on this plate as unclear may be almost clear to almost completely indistinct so long as it is confidently readable in the context, but minor details such as scribal mistakes may in fact be different than shown here. Text shown as unclear with low certainty is poorly legible to all but lost and tentatively reconstructed from the vestiges. Text shown as supplied includes no interpretable vestiges and is tentatively reconstructed from context. My numbering of stanzas, which I believe to be correct, differs slightly from the numbering in KR's edition as well as from that in an earlier version of this digital edition created without access to the original.</p>
