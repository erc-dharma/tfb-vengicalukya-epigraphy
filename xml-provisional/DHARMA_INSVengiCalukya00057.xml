        <note>Much of this line is badly damaged, which is why PS seems to have read only a small part of it. There is certainly no lacuna where he indicates one, but there are plenty of unmarked gaps in his reading. My reading is fraught with uncertainty, but plausible. I make no further emendation to <foreign>saṁprāpta</foreign>, whose function in the syntax is uncertain. Perhaps <foreign>saṁprāpya</foreign> was intended, or more simply but resulting in an awkwardly divided sentence, <foreign>saṁprāptaṁ</foreign>.</note>

<div type="commentary">
<p>PS reports the seal of this set as engraved with the legend <foreign>śrī-viṣamasiddhi</foreign> and depicting the sun and moon above it and the <foreign>varāha</foreign> and an <foreign>aṅkuśa</foreign> below it. I include the reported seal inscription in my edition, but note that the plates were loose when I inspected them in 2023 and no seal was attached to the bundle. It may have been misplaced in the meantime, or a seal may have been wrongly associated with the plates when PS studied them.</p>
<p>There has been some confusion about the identity of the issuer of these plates, which has now been cleared up on the basis of good photographs of the original. According to the ARIE report, the plates were issued by a <q>Maṅgi, son of Indra Bhaṭṭāraka</q>, but the report makes no issue of the fact that no such ruler is known, and treats another set of plates, issued by Maṅgi son of Viṣṇuvardhana and grandson of Indra Bhaṭṭāraka as belonging to the same king. According to Padmanabha Sastry’s discussion, the issuer is <q>the King Bhaṭṭāraka Maṅgi mahārāja, the son of Pr̥thivīvallabha (… pr̥thivīvallabha nāmadheyasya putriṇa bhaṭṭāraka Maṅgirājan…)</q>. Even before photographing the original plates in 2023, I had proposed that this person may rather have been the instigator of the grant, and the issuing king is more likely to be Viṣṇuvardhana II, whom the plate introduces in regular succession as the grandson of Viṣṇuvardhana (I) and son of Indra Bhaṭṭāraka.</p>
<p>Having now studied the photographs, I can ascertain beyond a shadow of doubt that this is indeed the case. Further, the instigator is named Bhaṭṭāra Mañcirāja, not Maṅgirāja. Indeed, the Jain institution receiving the donation bears his name (line 18), which was correctly read for the ARIE report and printed almost correctly in PS’s edition, but the connection between this name and that of the instigator has not been made previously. The reason for the confusion, apart from the similarity of the names Maṅgi and Mañci, may have been that Mañcirāja is the son of a person named Pr̥thivīvallabha. It is, however, not uncommon for subordinates to be named after sovereign kings. This Pr̥thivīvallabha is clearly stated to belong to the Ayyaṇa family, and not the Cālukya royal house.</p>
<p>The name of the Ayyaṇa family has not been read previously in this grant, but it is known from the <ref target="DHARMA_INSVengiCalukya00080.xml">Musinikuṇḍa grant of Viṣṇuvardhana III</ref> according to which a Cālukya queen originating from this family supported a Jain monastery. (See also my commentary to that grant: there may even have been two such queens, one of Viṣṇuvardhana I and another of Viṣṇuvardhana III.) A man (with royal titulature) belonging to this family (spelt Ayyaṇa) was the executor of the <ref target="DHARMA_INSVengiCalukya00050.xml">Cendalūr plates of Maṅgi Yuvarāja</ref>, royal territorial officers belonging to this family are mentioned in the <ref target="DHARMA_INSVengiCalukya00013.xml">Koṇeki grant of Viṣṇuvardhana II</ref>, and a woman of the Ayāṇa or Āyāṇa family, possibly unrelated, appears in the <ref target="DHARMA_INSVengiCalukya00070.xml">Īnteṟu grant of Bādapa</ref>.</p>
<p>The locality Kaṁsārivāda mentioned in line 25 is reminiscent of a Kaṁsāryya mentioned in the second Kondavidu set of Pr̥thvīśrīmūla (EIAD 0188). Together with the possible parallel between the same grant’s Taṁgodunaruva and the <ref target="DHARMA_INSVengiCalukya00056.xml">first Peddāpurappāḍu set</ref>’s Taṅgomanūṟuvu, this might be an indication that the Jain monastery mentioned in the three Peddāpurappāḍu sets in fact lay in the vicinity of Tāṇḍikoṇḍa. Peddapurappadu, where the plates are supposed to have been discovered, is in Krishna district, but there is a Pedakurapadu northwest of Guntur, as well as a Kasipadu nearby which may perhaps be Kasimi, so I wonder if the findspot has been correctly recorded. Even if it has, the findspot is of course no guarantee that the charter concerns land in the same region.</p>
<p>It is not clear to me what function the boundary description on 3v serves. It may be the case that in the main body of the grant, the boundaries of the totality of the granted land were specified, and the more specific boundaries of the smaller field are stated here. It is also possible that this is a supplementary grant, or the description of the plot for the precincts of the institution. The location of this passage on an outer face, after the closing prayer and a closer symbol, suggests a subsequent addition. Both the lines and the characters of each line are more widely spaced here than in the main body of the text, and the space above, below and to the left of the hole is not utilised. The hand, however, is not distinguishable from the hand responsible for the rest of the charter.</p>
