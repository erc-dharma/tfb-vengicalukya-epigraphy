        <note>Much of this line is badly damaged, which is why PS seems to have read only a small part of it. There is certainly no lacuna where he indicates one, but there are plenty of unmarked gaps in his reading. The readings I show with low certainty are very tentative and probably wrong in several places, but I am quite confident about the characters merely shown as unclear, without low certainty. Because of the questionable nature of my reading, I emend in the text only where the received reading is reasonably secure. If my readings are anywhere near correct, the intended text might have run along the lines of <foreign>senāpati-rājapuruṣādīn kāraṇikāṁś ca. tāṁbraśāsanam idaṁ saṁprāpya viditam astu vaḥ</foreign>.</note>

        <note>The reading is quite certain apart from <foreign>vr̥kṣāvaśahana</foreign>, which I am unable to interpret. The character read as <foreign>śa</foreign> is definitely not <foreign>rā</foreign>, as read by PS. It probably lacks the crossbar that would make it an unambiguous <foreign>śa</foreign>, but its left limb bends back in a loop and its headmark is a broad horizontal line, while all instances of <foreign>ga</foreign> in the plates have plain left limbs ending in a downward point and have a short stem below a narrow headmark. Thus, while <foreign>gahana</foreign> is at least a meaningful word, the correct reading is something else. I wonder if the composer's intent involved <foreign>rohaṇa</foreign>?</note>

<div type="commentary">
<p>PS reports the seal of this set as engraved with the legend <foreign>śrī-viṣamasiddhi</foreign> and depicting the sun and moon above it and the <foreign>varāha</foreign> and an <foreign>aṅkuśa</foreign> below it. I include the reported seal inscription in my edition, but note that the plates were loose when I inspected them in 2023 and no seal was attached to the bundle. It may have been misplaced in the meantime, or a seal may have been wrongly associated with the plates when PS studied them.</p>
<p>The identity of the issuer of these plates is uncertain, and the text as printed by PS is not intelligible with regard to this. According to the ARIE report, the plates were issued by a <q>Maṅgi, son of Indra Bhaṭṭāraka</q>, but the report makes no issue of the fact that no such ruler is known, and treats another set of plates, issued by Maṅgi son of Viṣṇuvardhana and grandson of Indra Bhaṭṭāraka as belonging to the same king. According to Padmanabha Sastry’s discussion, the issuer is <q>the King Bhaṭṭāraka Maṅgi mahārāja, the son of Pr̥thivīvallabha (… pr̥thivīvallabha nāmadheyasya putriṇa bhaṭṭāraka Maṅgirājan…)</q>. However, the preamble of the grant very definitely leads up to Viṣṇuvardhana II, introducing him as the grandson of Viṣṇuvardhana (I) and son of Indra Bhaṭṭāraka, then introducing him in line 8 as Viṣṇuvardhana (II) with a long list of ornamental epithets, all in the nominative. Further on, in line 11, PS prints literally, <q>upadeśa-labdhena vijñap itḥ-eva-m ājñāpayati</q>. This must surely mean that Viṣṇuvardhana II (introduced above in the nominative) commands as follows, having been petitioned (<foreign>vijñapitaḥ</foreign>) by someone who in turn heeded (<foreign>labdhena</foreign>) the religious instruction of Kanakanandi (introduced in lines 10 and 11) to do so. The problematic Maṅgi is introduced in between the two points, in lines 8 and 9. The words are printed by PS literally as follows: <q>[mu]dinī grāmau . . vī lokasya pr̥thivī-vallabha nāmadheyasya putriṇo(tro) Bhaṭṭāraka Maṅgirājaḥ</q>. If we reject the emendation of <foreign>putriṇo</foreign> (cited in his discussion as <foreign>putriṇa</foreign>) into <foreign>putro</foreign>, and instead read it as (or emend it to) <foreign>putreṇa</foreign>, then we have an instrumental here, to be picked up by <foreign>labdhena</foreign> in line 11. The only problem with this is the apparent nominative <foreign>maṅgirājaḥ</foreign>, which must then be emended to <foreign>maṅgirājena</foreign> (or an instrumental ending might be found in the unintelligible syllables read after this by PS).</p>
<p>Thus, the grant was probably made by Viṣṇuvardhana II, on the instance of Maṅgi. The latter was probably a subordinate, perhaps related to the royal Cālukya line, or he and his father may have borne names shared with that line out of affectation. It is also possible that he is Viṣṇuvardhana II’s son, later known as Maṅgi Yuvarāja. But the title <foreign>bhaṭṭāraka</foreign> does not seem appropriate for a prince, and the manner of his introduction implies that he was the son of some other <foreign>pr̥thivī-vallabha</foreign> than Viṣṇuvardhana II.</p>
<p>The seal legend <foreign>viṣamasiddhi</foreign>, if genuine, also speaks against identifying the issuer as Maṅgi Yuvarāja, and there is a final piece of independent, though circumstantial, evidence for assigning this charter to Viṣṇuvardhana II. The <ref target="DHARMA_INSVengiCalukya00056.xml">Peddāpurappāḍu plates (set 1) of Viṣṇuvardhana II</ref>, discovered together with the present plates, record a grant to presumably the very same <foreign>ācārya</foreign> Kanakanandi, and are dated (probably) in the first year of Viṣṇuvardhana II. Dating the present plates to the second year of Maṅgi Yuvarāja would separate the two grants in time (albeit only by about ten years), whereas dating them to the second year of Viṣṇuvardhana II would put them very close to one another.
