        <note>There is quite a lot of damage around these characters, though the characters themselves are all clear.

        <note>Rangacharya notes that the <foreign>visarga</foreign> is cut twice. There is also quite extensive damage behind these otherwise clear characters; possibly, a previous reading (also ending in a <foreign>visarga</foreign>) was struck out and the current one engraved over it.</note>

        <note>According to Rangacharya's editor, what Rangacharya saw as an <foreign>i</foreign> is only a crack in the plate, and the <foreign>e</foreign> is clearly present as the expected vowel marker. While the latter is correct, the crack seems to be there in addition to a fully formed <foreign>i mātrā</foreign>, so I assume the engraving was corrected.</note>

        <note>I am hesitant to alter a reading that has made its way into the name of this grant, yet I am quite certain that Rangacharya's reading is incorrect, and the character we have here is a cursive <foreign>lo</foreign>. In glyphs for <foreign>lī</foreign> that I could find, if the vowel mark is a spiral open on the top, then the tail is on the left side. Compare the identical-looking <foreign>lo</foreign> in lokāśrayā°, line 18 of the <ref target="CalE18-Peddavegi-Jayasimha1.xml">Peddavegi plates</ref>, and the different (though unclear) <foreign>lī</foreign> in <foreign>vimalīkr̥ta</foreign>, line 17 of the <ref target="CalE17-Niduparu-Jayasimha1.xml">Niḍupaṟu Grant</ref>. Rangacharya also gives the plausible-looking reconstruction <foreign>pulibūru</foreign>, which would indicate that <foreign>pulībūṁra</foreign> is to be preferred; however, his tentative identification with modern Polamūru does not rule out <foreign>pulobūṁra</foreign>. The reading reported in ARIE is <foreign>pulebūṁra</foreign> with the <foreign>e</foreign> marked as uncertain, and reading <foreign>le</foreign> does not seem possible.</note>

        <note>According to Rangacharya, the letter <foreign>vyā</foreign> <q>is indistinct, the lower part alone being clear. It is further beneath the punctuation mark and not separate.</q> I see no punctuation mark, nor does Rangacharya print one in his edition. There is also no subscript <foreign>y</foreign>, only a clear <foreign>yo</foreign>. Further, both instances of <foreign>ś</foreign> have conspicuous horns, which do not occur in any <foreign>śa</foreign> in these plates, all of which have plain, rounded tops. These may be <foreign>o mātrā</foreign>s shortened to conserve space (being different from the <foreign>śo</foreign> of <foreign>yaśo</foreign> in l7), or they may be ornamentation. Given the obscurity of these names/terms, I have no way of confidently interpreting the text. Rangacharya may be correct in assuming that <foreign>yo</foreign> was intended for <foreign>vyā</foreign>, in which case the intended text was probably <foreign>hastikośo vīrakośaḥ| vyāsa-gītāḥ</foreign>. Alternatively, <foreign>yo</foreign> may be deliberate, in which case <foreign>vyā</foreign> was omitted and is to be supplied in line 23. The intended text may thus have been <foreign>hastikośa-vīrakośayoḥ| vyāsa-gītāḥ</foreign>. See also the commentary.</note>

        <note>My reading is a desperate one, based on the scanned estampage and not pretending to be correct. In the ARIE report, the date is recorded as <q>[1]5th year (in numerical symbols), [śu.] di. 6, [Sunday]</q>. A punctuation mark does not seem likely here, but the two verticals after <foreign>saṁ</foreign> resemble nothing else. The next character is probably what the ARIE report read as 5; I would be more inclined to see it as 10, but it resembles neither the 5 nor the 10 in line 20 of the <ref target="CalE11-Cipurupalle-Visnuvardhana1.xml">Cīpurupalle plates</ref>. This may be followed by another character or even two, squeezed underneath the descender of the first <foreign>yasya</foreign> in the previous line. After this comes a character that may be <foreign>di</foreign> and was probably read as such in ARIE. I would expect either a month name or, as in the, <ref target="CalE11-Cipurupalle-Visnuvardhana1.xml">Cīpurupalle plates</ref>, <foreign>mā</foreign> here. The next character is probably what was read as 6 in ARIE, followed by what may be <foreign>vi</foreign>, which may have prompted the ARIE decipherer to write Sunday. There is possibly one more character with an <foreign>i</foreign>, or perhaps a punctuation mark, after this.</note>

  <!-- Page 1 is clearly paginated on the verso, with the number 1 in the upper part of the left margin, and with lines 2 and 3 on that page indented to leave some clear space around the number. There may be a numeral 2 in a similar position on the verso of page 2, but the text lines do not make way for this one, and it is a simpler glyph consisting of two straight lines, whereas the 1 is a strongly curved line. I assume it is also pagination (Rangacharya p254: <q>The plates are numbered, though the figure on the first plate alone is clear.</q>), but it may have been added after inscribing the text. I see no page number on the recto of page 3 (unless three dots in a rough triangle, in the left margin between the third and fourth line on that page qualify as one), and there is no facsimile of the verso. -->
<!--Further to the apparatus entry on hastikoś<choice><unclear>a</unclear><unclear>o</unclear></choice> vīrakoś<choice><unclear>a</unclear><unclear>o</unclear></choice> yo<lb/>sa-gītāḥ in line 22. The ARIE report, Rangacharya and his editor all agree on understanding these two terms as the designations of two offices, and make no issue of the singular ājñapti being in apposition to them. Rangacharya notes (258 n 4), <quote>The word <foreign>kōśa</foreign> has different meanings in Tamil classical literature. Dr. Krishnaswami Aiyangar identifies the Kōśar who invaded the Pāṇḍyan kingdom with the vanguards of the Vamba or later (or illegitimate) Mauryas and connects them with the Kōśakāras of Assam referred to in the <title>Rāmāyaṇa</title>. The Kōśars seem to have been not only a particular tribe but (1) soldiers in general; (2) followers or relatives of kings corresponding to the Sanskrit Rājanyas; (3) officers of justice in village courts, etc. In the present record the word seems to mean, as the Govt. Epigraphist points out, an officer.</quote> Sircar (IEG s.vv. hastikośa, vīrakośa) endorses this interpretation. Given the uncertainty of the reading, possibly a dual genitive was intended instead, but I do not know of a parallel where the ājñapti is said to be someone's (rather than someone). What I find most likely is that the intent was hastikośo vīrakośaḥ, but one of these (most likely the latter) is a name, and only the other (the former) is an office. It may even be possible that hastikośa was used instead of hastyadhyakṣa or another better-known term in order to play on the name vīrakośa. -->
