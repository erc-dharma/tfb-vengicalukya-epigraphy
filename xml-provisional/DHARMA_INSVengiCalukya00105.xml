                     <summary><p>Anusvāra is usually a small dot at headline level, sometimes a small circle at median level. Short and long dependent ī are barely distinguishable, the latter being open at the bottom left, the former being normally closed into a circle. Final M is a reduced and simplified old-style ma. The plates are written in a very clumsy hand. The last line, squeezed into insufficient vertical space, begins with an indent of about 3 characters and skips many spots where there are descenders from the penultimate line.

        <note>The broken-off corner of the plate is too small to have accommodated two lost characters comfortably. Either they were very small, or only one was inscribed and the other omitted by the scribe. MDS is unlikely to have seen those characters, since SS also shows them as lost and supplied.</note>

<div type="commentary">
<p>This charter could be called the Ariyeṟu grant, but in order to distinguish it more clearly from the <ref target="DHARMA_INSVengiCalukya00093.xml">Ariyeṟa grant of Viṣṇuvardhana III</ref>, I refer to it, along with earlier editors, as the Gaṇapavaram plates.</p>
<p>Between the end of plate 2 recto and the beginning of plate 2 verso, the text changes abruptly. The scribal hand changes only a little (see the palaeographic description), but the number of lines per plate is five up to this point and seven after it, and the number of characters per line also increases by 25% or more. There is also a glitch in the text, with <foreign>samasta-bhuvanāśraya-śrī-vijayādi</foreign> unfinished, then followed by <foreign>śrī-maṁgi-yuvarājasya</foreign>. Note that <foreign>śrī</foreign> is not normally used twice in a name, and that <foreign>samasta-bhuvanāśraya</foreign> first occurs for Vijayāditya I and is nowhere else employed as an epithet of Maṅgi Yuvarāja (who is <foreign>sarva-lokāśraya</foreign>). It is likewise incompatible with Viṣṇuvardhana III (also <foreign>sarva-lokāśraya</foreign>). </p>
<p>The primary byname of Maṅgi Yuvarāja is <foreign>vijaya-siddhi</foreign><note>in the text of four of the five known complete charters attributable to him with certainty (<ref target="DHARMA_INSVengiCalukya00014.xml">Nutulapaṟu grant</ref>, <ref target="DHARMA_INSVengiCalukya00048.xml">London plates</ref>, <ref target="DHARMA_INSVengiCalukya00050.xml">Cendalūr plates</ref>, <ref target="DHARMA_INSVengiCalukya00072.xml">Elūru grant</ref>) and on the seal of all five (the fifth being the <ref target="DHARMA_INSVengiCalukya00090.xml">Peñceṟekuru grant</ref>), as well as in numerous grants of his successors</note>, so the characters vijayādi may be a misinterpretation of vijaya-siddhi traced on the plate for the engraver to carve. If the tracing had been faint or smudged, then si may have been mistaken by the artisan for an ā mātrā attached to ya, and the subscript dh of the next character may have been overlooked. This hypothesis, however, does not explain the other striking anomalies in the text.</p>
<p>The text up to the abrupt transition at the end of line 10 is literally identical to two grants (the <ref target="DHARMA_INSVengiCalukya00084.xml">Permmañcili grant </ref> and the <ref target="DHARMA_INSVengiCalukya00085.xml">Ḻūḷā grant</ref>; in the former, the ends of the first five lines are lost but can be confidently restored on the basis of the latter) that can be attributed with confidence to Viṣṇuvardhana IV (with a very slight chance that they belong to Viṣṇuvardhana V). This section of texts includes phrases found nowhere else in the corpus, such as <foreign>aneka-tulā-dhr̥ta-kaḷadhauta-dāna-pūta-śarīraḥ</foreign> and <foreign>samatiśayita-pitr̥-guṇaḥ śakti-sampannaḥ samyak-prajā-pālana-paraḥ</foreign> (with <foreign>-paraḥ</foreign> missing, presumably by mistake, in the two cited grants). In the two grants cited, the text continues with <foreign>vijayāditya-mahārājasya priya-tanayaḥ</foreign> (corresponding to <foreign>vijayādi śrī-maṁgi-yuvarājasya putraḥ</foreign> in the present grant), and is then again identical up to the name of the district, except for the anomalous <foreign>samasta-bhuvanāśraya-śrī-viṣṇuvarddhana</foreign> of the present grant, for which the other two have the expected <foreign>sarvva-lokāśraya-śrī-viṣnuvarddhana</foreign>.</p>
<p>The royal style <foreign>mahārājādhirāja-parameśvara-bhaṭṭāraka</foreign> is never used in the corpus before Vijayāditya I. The phrase <foreign>ājñaptir asya dharmasya</foreign> (an <foreign>anuṣṭubh</foreign> quarter) is common in the grants of Vijayāditya I and recurs in some of his successors’ charters (including the two grants of Viṣṇuvardhana IV noted for their similarity to the present grant), but is not reliably attested before his time.<note>The phrase occurs in the probably spurious <ref target="DHARMA_INSVengiCalukya00088.xml">Pamiḍimukkala plates (set 1) of Viṣṇuvardhana II, year 3</ref>  and the possibly spurious <ref target="DHARMA_INSVengiCalukya00092.xml">Pasapubaṟṟu grant of Viṣṇuvardhana III</ref> .</note> The name of the executor Nissaramiṇyi, however, is attested (with variations and/or illegible details) in grants by Maṅgi Yuvarāja<note>The <ref target="DHARMA_INSVengiCalukya00014.xml">Nutulapaṟu grant</ref>, where Fleet reads <foreign>nissarami<unclear cert="low">ji</unclear></foreign> (no visual documentation available) and the <ref target="DHARMA_INSVengiCalukya00048.xml">London plates</ref> where the reading is fairly certainly <foreign>nissāramiṇḍi</foreign></note> and Jayasiṁha II,<note>The <ref target="DHARMA_INSVengiCalukya00060.xml">Cendaṟa grant</ref>, where Ramesan reads <foreign>vissarami<gap reason="lost" quantity="2" unit="character"/></foreign> but the correct reading is more likely <foreign>nissarami</foreign> followed by a single character which is very probably <foreign>ṇi</foreign> with a lost subscript component </note> so he may have been active in the early part of Viṣṇuvardhana III’s reign, but certainly not under any later king.</p>
<p>These discrepancies, coupled with the absence of a seal and my observation that the first two seem to be slightly hourglass-shaped, while the third is rather rectangular (although whether they are truly different is difficult to assess from the estampages), imply that the charter is in some way spurious. Up to line 10, our inscription is probably a genuine charter of Viṣṇuvardhana IV that had been left unfinished, or was copied verbatim from such a charter. The rest of the text appears to have been clumsily edited to give it a semblance of earliness, substituting the name of Maṅgi Yuvarāja into the introduction of Vijayāditya I, using the wrong cognomen for the issuer, and substituting the probably misspelled name of a long-ago courtier into a modern phrase introducing the executor. The contents of the executive section may be fraudulent, but they may also represent a legitimate (though careless) reissue of an older grant. The similarity of the writing in the two sections suggests that the second part was written not long after the first, probably in the same workshop, and possibly by the same scribe.</p>
