                    <p>Other palaeographic observations. A neat and clipped hand with beautiful orthogonal characters, but becoming untidy on plate 3, which is more crowded than the others. Anusvāra is normally above the character to which it belongs. It may also be atop the next character, when required by descenders from the previous line (e.g. l5 triṁśad) or in non-Sanskritic words (e.g. l6 maṁgi), and is occasionally slightly to the left of the character to which it belongs (l10 Aṣṭottāraṁ). The length of the vowels a, i and u is hardly better than random, and the distinction between i and ī is particularly poor. I give the engraver the benefit of doubt when there is any ambiguity, but show most instances of mistaken vowel length as errors. Rare initial Ai occurs in line 47.

        <note>The initial <foreign>v</foreign> is quite clear, so <foreign>-vyākr̥tāneka-</foreign> would be a smaller emendation.

        <note>The text is interpretable without my emendation. It seems to me, however, that a <foreign>gaṇacchandas</foreign> line starts with <foreign>kali-viṭṭara-</foreign>. In addition to the more or less correct prosody of that passage (see also the next note), the birth of Vijayāditya III from Viṣṇuvardhana V and Śīla-mahādevī has just been related above. Repeating this information in prose would be very awkward, while a restatement is acceptable if the diction now changes to verse. However, if I am correct in assuming that the following part is verse, then it is a single hemistich, since from <foreign>bhadra-ghaṭa</foreign> onward we have a fairly correct and coherent <foreign>gaṇacchandas</foreign> stanza. On the other hand, I see no way to fit the text before <foreign>kali-viṭṭara-</foreign> to metre. The <ref target="DHARMA_INSVengiCalukya00095.xml">Uṟuvuṭūru grant</ref> has a clear <foreign>visarga</foreign> here and also switches to verse at this point, but the stanza that follows there is analogous to stanza 2 of the present text.</note>

        <note>This may be an alternative name of the queen mother, or a scribal error for <foreign>śīla-mahādevyāś</foreign>.

        <lem><sic>dhanaya</sic></lem>
        <note>I would expect a plural substantive meaning something like "subjects" or "the poor" here, but other meanings may also work. With the uninterpretable received reading, the line is a mostly correct second hemistich of an <foreign>āryā</foreign> stanza, with metrical licence in the fourth foot where the <foreign>ni</foreign> of <foreign>ajani</foreign> must be scanned as short in spite of the following <foreign>pr</foreign>. If <foreign>dhanaya</foreign> is erroneous, then it should most probably be corrected so that it becomes five morae in length, three of them in the second foot and two in the third. This would yield a prosodically correct 30-mora line (such as the second hemistich of a <foreign>gīti</foreign>) without any metrical anomalies. The parallel stanza in the <ref target="DHARMA_INSVengiCalukya00095.xml">Uṟuvuṭūru grant</ref> reads <foreign>jīvanti dhanā katham iti</foreign> and continues differently than here. That text is also unintelligible as received, but emendation to <foreign>jīvanty adhanāḥ katham iti</foreign> or <foreign>jīvanti janāḥ katham iti</foreign> would render it metrically and semantically correct. Returning to the present locus, emendation <foreign>nirdhanāḥ</foreign>, or possibly to <foreign>jātayaḥ</foreign> or <foreign>jantavaḥ</foreign>, would make sense in the context and produce correct metre.</note>

        <note>My emendations are tentative throughout this hemistich, and my interpretation (see the translation) is rather forced.

        <note>The first consonant may perhaps be a misshapen <foreign>b</foreign>, but I see no way to derive meaning with that reading.

        <note>Aside from the occasional meaningful word, I am unable to interpret this stretch or restore it with any plausibility. Most of the characters are clear. I believe, but am not entirely certain, that an original <foreign>rā</foreign> has been cdorrected to <foreign>ri</foreign> by putting a dot on either side of the <foreign>ā</foreign> marker and adding the <foreign>i</foreign> marker (see the note to line 20). My <foreign>dva</foreign> may perhaps be <foreign>ddha</foreign>, but other instances of <foreign>ddha</foreign> have a much larger subscript component with a conspicuously notched bottom. The following <foreign>ni</foreign> may perhaps be a misshapen <foreign>bhi</foreign>. As received, it is also gravely unmetrical, but it was probably intended to be a <foreign>gaṇacchandas</foreign> passage. I also find the two occurrences of <foreign>adya</foreign> suspect and believe that the second may be a scribal error for <foreign>asya</foreign>. The hemistich may have said something to the effect that Vijayāditya's residence seems to be filled with the light of the sun and the moon (in his insignia?), but until and unless a less corrupt parallel comes to the surface, I see no hope of reconstructing it.</note>

        <note>The first hemistich of this stanza scans correctly with 32 morae as shown here, or with 30 morae if <foreign>sadā</foreign> is shifted to the next hemistich. However, I see no way to fit the second half to a regular metre. Counting <foreign>sadā</foreign> in the second half, a 32-mora line can be obtained with minor emendations (<foreign>ḍhakkā</foreign> to <foreign>ḍhakka</foreign>, <foreign>puri</foreign> to <foreign>purā</foreign>, <foreign>digantara</foreign> to <foreign>digantaraṁ</foreign>), but this has a faulty caesura (<foreign>ma|hāśabda</foreign>, and moreover, the combination of 30+32-mora hemistichs (<foreign>lalitā</foreign>) is rare and not known in the Veṅgī corpus before the time of Bhīma II. I therefore think that the first line is likely to include <foreign>sadā</foreign>. This way, <foreign>paḍa-ḍhakkā-pañca-mahā</foreign> produce the correct first 3 feet, while <foreign>digantaraṁ nirgamane</foreign> (with an added <foreign>anusvāra</foreign>) make the correct last 3 feet of another 32-mora line, or <foreign>ra°-nirgamane</foreign> (without the supplied <foreign>anusvāra</foreign>) may be the last 3 feet of a 27-mora, but further emendations are needed in both cases in the central two feet. For a partial parallel, the <ref target="DHARMA_INSVengiCalukya00095.xml">Uṟuvuṭūru grant</ref> includes a garbled hemistich that seems to read <foreign>yasya vijetuḫ purataḥ pañca-mahā-śabda-saṁhati-svānati purāḥ</foreign>.</note>

        <note>Given the partial parallel cited in the previous note, I believe that this is a corruption of a word meaning "preceded by" compounded to the previous words, and not a word meaning "town" connected to the following words.

<p>The first 10 lines are almost verbatim identical to those of the <ref target="DHARMA_INSVengiCalukya00062.xml">Ciṁbulūru plates of Vijayāditya III</ref> and the first 18 lines to the <ref target="DHARMA_INSVengiCalukya00095.xml">Uṟuvuṭūru grant of Vijayāditya III</ref>. The description of the donees (ll. 35-38) is identical to that in the <ref target="DHARMA_INSVengiCalukya00062.xml">Ciṁbulūru plates</ref>. The rest of the <foreign>praśasti</foreign> bears close resemblance to <ref target="DHARMA_INSVengiCalukya00095.xml">Uṟuvuṭūru grant</ref>, and to no other Eastern Cālukya charter that I know of. The <ref target="DHARMA_INSVengiCalukya00095.xml">Uṟuvuṭūru grant</ref> and the present text record the length of Viṣṇuvardhana V’s reign as 20 months, whereas all other known charters that state its duration give 18 months (or a year and a half), or “two autumns”.</p>
<p>The donated village Pulgoṭlapaṁbuluru is bordered on the north by Mṟropaṟṟu, while the latter village (with a slightly different spelling) is donated in the <ref target="DHARMA_INSVengiCalukya00054.xml">Mḻopaṟṟu grant</ref>, attributed to Maṅgi Yuvarāja but in all probability made or reissued in the time of Vijayāditya III. That village Mḻopaṟṟu is bordered on the south by Pulgoṭlapabulūru. These two grants are the only ones mentioning Cavuḻpallya <foreign>viṣaya</foreign>. The five exhortatory stanzas in the present charter are identical (down to their details and sequence) to the first five in the <ref target="DHARMA_INSVengiCalukya00054.xml">Mḻopaṟṟu grant</ref>, while three of them are otherwise rare in the corpus.</p>

  <p>No report and no previous edition of this grant is known. The present edition was created for DHARMA by Dániel Balogh, on the basis of photographs taken by myself in February 2023 at the Andhra Sahitya Parishad Museum, Kakinada. Someone at some point must have read the plates at least cursorily, because the item is recorded in the Museum's catalogue with the name of the ruler and the granted village.</p>
