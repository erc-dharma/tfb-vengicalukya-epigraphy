The seal currently (2023) associated with the plates in the Eluru Museum cannot be the original, since the ASI cover sheet and Hultzsch agree that the seal legend is śrī-viṣamasiddhi, and the emblem shows a star or the sun in the crescent moon. The seal in the museum bears the legend śrī-sarvvasiddhi and has only the moon above the legend.

Satyānandam, a Mādiga Christian, had found the plates (year of discovery not reported) while digging for old earth near the village Oruvakallu at the foot of a 250-foot granite boulder. The boulder is reportedly to the west of the village and has a cave with a Gaṅgā temple, and a number of mounds and ruins nearby.

The surface is broken at the seal and cut opposite the seal, implying that the rest of the ring was still extant when the set was opened for study. The seal is likewise broken; it seems to have been an oval about 4 cm wide and 3 cm tall, of which only the upper part is now extant, with a probable crescent moon and possibly a sun within the crescent. Katti and Padmanabha Sastry, however, do not report any breakage and give account of an intact seal (reporting no dimensions), bearing a crescent above, a legend in the middle and a lotus at the bottom. In their account, the ring's diameter is 6 cm, which matches the inner diameter measured by me. The ARIE does not mention the seal at all, although it does report the seal legends for other Veṅgī Cālukya plates noticed in the same volumt. It is possible that the seal currently associated with the plates is not original.
