The surface is broken at the seal and cut opposite the seal, implying that the rest of the ring was still extant when the set was opened for study. The seal is likewise broken; it seems to have been an oval about 4 cm wide and 3 cm tall, of which only the upper part is now extant, with what seems to be an image of the sun and the moon. Katti and Padmanabha Sastry, however, do not report any breakage and give account of an intact seal (reporting no dimensions), bearing a crescent above, a legend in the middle and a lotus at the bottom. In their account, the ring's diameter is 6 cm, which matches the inner diameter measured by me. The ARIE does not mention the seal at all. The ring and seal currently associated with the plates are thus probably not original. There is a slight chance that the seal currently associated with 00016 belonged to this set.No discovery information available.
