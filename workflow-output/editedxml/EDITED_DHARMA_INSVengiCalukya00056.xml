                     <p>Halantas. Final M is much the same shape as regular ma, including a headmark (which may, however, be detached from the body and/or be bent into an U shape unlike the tilde-shaped headmark), and is only slightly reduced in size. The juxtaposition in l17 bhagavatām arhatāM shows that the two glyphs do differ. PS reads its instances as ma, emending to anusvāra. A more typical, more simplified form without a headmark also occurs, e.g. l25 phalaM. Final T is also almost full-sized, but lacks a headmark.</p>
                     <p>Original punctuation marks. The closing symbol is probably meant to be a concentric circle, but may also be a clockwise spiral. It looks somewhat like the character la, but is definitely not alphabetic.</p>
                     <p>Other palaeographic observations. An alternative, flatter shape of l (much the same as the subscript form used in lla) is used in li when there is no headroom, e.g. l13 kali, l23 cānupālitā, l27 paripālitaḥ.

        <note>In his discussion, PR subtly further modifies the reading to just <foreign>navakarmma-sāra</foreign>, which he considers to be a reference to nine works apparently called <foreign>sāra</foreign>s by Koṇḍakuṇḍācārya. I utterly fail to see why these works would be mentioned in the context. The ARIE correctly says that the grant’s purposes included <foreign>navakarmasaraṇa</foreign>. I accept this word as correct, interpreting it as "uninterrupted continuation". The parallel locus in the <ref target="DHARMA_INSVengiCalukya00096.xml">third Peddāpurappāḍu set</ref> reads <foreign>śaraṇārtthaM</foreign>, which I find inferior.</note>

        <note>PS’s use of the double hyphen for transliterated characters belonging to a single <foreign>akṣara</foreign> is unreliable, so the text may be <foreign>-nadyāt</foreign>; conceivably, this may also be a misreading of <foreign>-nadyāḥ</foreign> or <foreign>-nadyāḫ</foreign>.</note>

        <note>In PS’s edition, the name is set with a line break after <foreign>jemanū</foreign> and a large space after <foreign>r</foreign>. I assume that his author manuscript used the Telugu character <foreign>ṟ</foreign> here, which the typesetter of the paper messed up. In the plate, the character I read tentatively as <foreign>ta</foreign> is atop the break between the two halves of the plate, and has been partly rubbed off at the edge. In the next character, the <foreign>g</foreign> component is very faint but quite clear, and the strokes for the vowel <foreign>o</foreign> have been attached to the top of this component rather than to the upper <foreign>ṅ</foreign> component, presumably because the descender of <foreign>rttha</foreign> in the previous line was in the way. In spite of the non-standard execution, the reading is reasonably certain. A field named Taṁgodunaruva is mentioned in the mid-sixth century Kondavidu set II of Pr̥thvīśrīmūla (EIAD 0188), in the vicinity of Tāṇḍikoṇḍa. The present charter probably concerns a different region (although see my commentary to the <ref target="DHARMA_INSVengiCalukya00057.xml">second Peddāpurappāḍu set</ref>), but the attestation of that name adds to the plausibility of my reading. In <foreign>pūrvve</foreign>, I emend to harmonise with the rest of this part of the sentence, but retaining <foreign>pūrvva</foreign> in compound or emending to <foreign>pūrvvataḥ</foreign> would also be acceptable.</note>

        <note>In PS’s edition, this word is set with a line break after <foreign>Inte</foreign> and a large space after <foreign>r</foreign>. I assume, but may be mistaken, that his author manuscript used the Telugu character <foreign>ṟ</foreign> here, which the typesetter of the paper messed up. PS may have been aware of the <ref target="DHARMA_INSVengiCalukya00070.xml">Īnteṟu grant of Bādapa</ref> and been influenced by the name of that village in <foreign>velānāṇḍu-viṣaya</foreign>. Here, the second character’s principal consonant is clearly <foreign>ṇ</foreign>. The rest is most likely <foreign>ṭha</foreign> mixed up with the vestiges of an earlier character (see the commentary), but possibly <foreign>ṭhu</foreign> or <foreign>ṟu</foreign>. The last character of the name is definitely <foreign>ru</foreign>, although a second curved stroke is attached to the bottom left of the consonant component, which may be a vestige or a slip of the chisel.</note>

        <note>The ARIE report gives this name as Pattipāka, along with the possible alternative Pattipāḍu. The segment <foreign>parttipā</foreign> is clear. The <foreign>ā</foreign> marker is notched and thus reminiscent of the later cursive <foreign>o</foreign>, but compare the similarly notched <foreign>ā</foreign> e.g. in l. 3 <foreign>pādānudhyātānāM</foreign>, as opposed to the bipartite <foreign>o</foreign> marker in l. 19 <foreign>potupa</foreign>. The last character of the name has the fracture line running through its body, and what may be a vowel marker atop it is tangled with the subscript part of <foreign>ści</foreign> in the previous like. It was this subscript that made the ARIE reader think of <foreign>ḍ</foreign>, with the body of <foreign>k</foreign> resembling a dependent <foreign>u</foreign> attached to it. That reading can be ruled out with certainty. I believe that no dependent vowel is attached to this last consonant.</note>

        <note>This line dips to avoid the descender of <foreign>rtr̥</foreign> in the previous line, while the next line is initially quite level.

Also, <foreign>ha</foreign> is partly obscured by the fracture line in the plate. Nonetheless, the reading <foreign>hared</foreign> is beyond doubt.

        <note>The characters <foreign>ma varṣa</foreign> increasingly overlap with the previous line (see also the note to line 26). Thereafter, the current line skips to the point after the large descender of <foreign>dbhū</foreign> and continues at a lower horizontal level. The fracture affects only the right limb of <foreign>ma</foreign> in this line. The character <foreign>va</foreign> looks rather like <foreign>ṣa</foreign> and may have been corrected from that. The end of the line is clearly <foreign>paripālitaḥ</foreign>; what PS may have taken for an <foreign>i</foreign> marker or <foreign>ni</foreign> (promting the rest of his reading) is in fact the subscript part of <foreign>śśā</foreign> in the previous line.

<div type="commentary">
<p>PS gives no physical description and mentions no seal, but one is described in the ARIE report, and was present when I examined the original.</p>
<p>Lines 19-21 (the last three lines on 2v) are a palimpsest over almost completely erased earlier text. The erasure has left the surface of the plates in a much rougher state throughout this zone. Vestiges of former characters are discernible in some spots, the clearest being a vertical stroke with an <foreign>i</foreign> marker on top to the right of <foreign>kṣi</foreign> in l20, <foreign>dakṣiṇe</foreign>; a probable <foreign>ddha</foreign> (possibly <foreign>ṣva</foreign>) within the first <foreign>grāmāT</foreign> in l20. Given the discontinuity at the beginning of 3r, it seems certain that the details of the village have been revised at more length than first inscribed (which may have been only two lines). The hand of these three lines may well be the same as in the rest of the plates.</p>
