                     <p>Halantas. Final T (e.g. l16 anvapālayaT) is a full-sized or even larger ta with a vertical tail instead of a headmark. Final N (e.g. l9 māsāN) is a reduced na without a headmark but with a full-length stem. Final M (l51 pautrikaM) is a small circle with a vertical tail, tiny in size, but the only instance is probably a scribal addition, and thus smaller than it would have been otherwise.</p>
                     <p>There are no punctuation marks in the text, but visargas (or double dots looking indistinguishable from visargas) are repeatedly employed superfluously in place of punctuation.</p>
                     <p>Other palaeographic observations. A neat and clipped hand with beautiful orthogonal characters. Many subscript consonants (not only r and y but also e.g. n and m) are ornamentally enlarged and stylised. Markers for dependent i, when interfering with a subscript stroke from the previous line, are only partially drawn. Anusvāra may be above the pertinent character on the right, or to the right of the pertinent character at or above head height, or occasionally over the next character, especially in non-Sanskritic words (e.g. l7 maṁgi where, unusually, it is above rather than within the i marker).
                      <!-- The script name(s) will be inserted here at a later stage from the metadata spreasheet. At this stage, you can mention here in a free-text paragraph any characteristics of the writing observed more than once in this inscription that seem unusual/uncommon or otherwise noteworthy given the general characteristics of the script in question. See EG 11.2. --></p>
                     <!-- If you need to identify individual hands (EG §7.5/) in addition to one or more paragraphs of general palaeographic description, wrap <summary> around the <p> or <p>s above, and, outside <summary>, create <handNote> elements for each hand as follows:

In the <ref target="DHARMA_INSVengiCalukya00097.xml">Pulgoṭlapaṁbuluru grant</ref>, the stanza is slightly different, and this locus reads <foreign>jīvanti dhanaya</foreign> (uninterpretable).</note>

        <note>My emendation may be unnecessary, as the text is interpretable without it. However, <foreign>anvarthana</foreign> is a barely attested word, and fits the context much less than the emended version. There is a small curved horizontal stroke between the headmarks of <foreign>na</foreign> and <foreign>va</foreign>, which may indicate that <foreign>na</foreign> has been corrected to <foreign>nā</foreign>, or that some other correction (not engraved anywhere) was to be made here.</note>

        <note>I emend with help from the differently corrupt parallel phrase in line 33 of the <ref target="DHARMA_INSVengiCalukya00097.xml">Pulgoṭlapaṁbuluru grant</ref>. I feel quite certain that <foreign>nr̥pāṁkakāri</foreign> was the composer’s intent here, but I am not entirely sure that the <foreign>anusvāra</foreign> is actually present, and if <foreign>pā</foreign> is inscribed rather than just <foreign>pa</foreign>, then the vowel marker partly overlaps the next character (so it may be a subsequent addition).</note>

        <note>I prefer to construe <foreign>śrī</foreign> as part of the writer’s name because I doubt that clerical staff would have had <foreign>śrī</foreign> as an honorary epithet, but the latter is of course also possible. The active verb <foreign>lilekha</foreign> is syntactically incorrect with the agent in the instrumental. The composer may have conceived of the verb as passive, or may have meant the name to be in the nominative (note the dative ending of the adjective qualifying the name). The <ref target="DHARMA_INSVengiCalukya00062.xml">Ciṁbuluru plates of Vijayāditya III</ref>, also inscribed by Śrīvijayācārya, spells this phrase in the same way, but does not add a second name or a second act of writing. I believe that the action performed by Śrīvijayācārya is in both texts reported with the verb <foreign>ālikh-</foreign> (see also my commentary), and do not emend to <foreign>śrīvijayācāryyeṇa</foreign>.</note>

        <note>The <foreign>i</foreign> marker is not discernible in the estampage, but clear in the photos of the original. In the bottom right corner, <foreign>dha</foreign> is faint but clear in the photos, but only its left half is visible in the estampage due to the closeness of the rim. What I read as <foreign>ra</foreign> completing this word is engraved in smaller size below and to the left of <foreign>vi</foreign>. The upper part of this character is very clear in the estampage, but only visible in the photo when one looks closely at the exact spot. Then, the rest of the character may also be made out very faintly. It may also have a headmark, in which case it is <foreign>ka</foreign>, but I do not see how and where that might fit the text (unless we are supposed to read <foreign>likhitaka</foreign>?)

<div type="commentary">
<p>The granted village, Uṟuvuṭūru, is in my opinion unlikely to be identical to Urp(p)uṭūru, the place of residence of two of the donees. The latter also appears in the <ref target="DHARMA_INSVengiCalukya00021.xml">Koṟṟapaṟṟu grant of Vijayāditya II</ref> as the residence of two donees, and in the <ref target="DHARMA_INSVengiCalukya00023.xml">Masulipatam plates of Vijayāditya III</ref> as the residence of the donee. It thus seems to be a major town with a Brahmanical school, and not an agrarian village that can be donated. Uṟuvuṭūru must be modern Uruturu at 16.31660772295342, 80.93557909586085. Its eastern neighbour Pabaṟṟu is modern Pamarru (2.8 km ENE, possibly identical to the subject of the <ref target="DHARMA_INSVengiCalukya00044.xml">Pāṁbaṟṟu grant of Amma II</ref>, but more likely not). The southern neighbour Pellāgalānu may then be modern Pedasanagallu (4.8 km SSW). To the west, there are three villages with names ending in -pudi, but none that sounds close to our text’s Kṣoppodi. The northern neighbour Kuṟumaddavalli is modern Kurumaddali (2 km WNW). Lacking additional clues, the identification of Urpuṭūru (and confirmation that it is not the same locality) is not possible. Modern Upputur, 41 km SW of Guntur (which may be Kuṇḍūru, the residence of one donee), near Parchoor, and only 8 km NNW of Karanchedu (the residence of several donees) is a possible candidate.<note>CHECK: JESI 8 pp. 46ff is a 15th-century inscription according to which Trilocana Pallava settled 1000 Brahmins from Ahicchatra at this Upputur, called Lavaṇapura in the inscription.</note></p>
<p>The colophon of the plates says they were written by Śrīvijayācārya of Vijayavāḍa, but in addition there is a second instance of a form of likh- and what I take to be another name: Vidyādhara. It seems most likely to me that these two people performed different actions associated with writing, and that the received text, although replete with incorrect vowels, is to be taken seriously as far as the boundary of Śrīvijayācārya’s name and the following verb is concerned. That is to say, I think the reading is not an erroneous spelling of <foreign>ācāryyeṇa lilekha</foreign> but a correct spelling of <foreign>ācāryyeṇa+ālilekha</foreign>. Śrīvijayācārya was also the writer of the <ref target="DHARMA_INSVengiCalukya00062.xml">Ciṁbuluru plates of Vijayāditya III</ref>, recorded in identical similar terms, <foreign>śrīvijayācāryyeṇālilekhā saśāna</foreign>, but without a second name and verb. Although the vowels are rather haphazard in both grants, this parallel may serve as some slight confirmation that the <foreign>ā</foreign> in question is to be accepted as deliberate. If my hunch that <foreign>ālikh</foreign> and <foreign>likh</foreign> denote different actions is correct, then the former probably refers to pre-drawing the text to be inscribed (in ink, in chalk, or with light scratches), given that its dictionary meanings (<bibl><ptr target="bib:MonierWilliams1899_01"/><citedRange unit="entry">ālikh</citedRange></bibl>) are specifically “to delineate by scratches” and “to mark, draw, write, delineate, paint.” The latter would then mean the actual engraving of the final text. This interpretation also fits my impression that the former action was done by a master (bearing the title <foreign>ācārya</foreign> and possibly the honorific <foreign>śrī</foreign>, though I prefer to see that as part of his name, and introduced at some length), and the latter by an apprentice or a less qualified artisan, whose name is added as a brief afterthought.</p>
<p>The ASI estampages are accompanied by two copies of a cover sheet, a draft with many insertions, and a largely identical clean copy. The latter says the following.</p>
<p>These are fine copper-plates the first and last of which are engraved on the inner sides only. They measure roughly 9½” by 3¾” and possess high rims which are evidently meant to protect the writing. Even the unwritten sides of the first and last plates have raised rims. Nearly ½” from the left margin of the plates are seen ring holes measuring ¾” in diameter. The ring with seal which holds these plates together is elliptical and measures 6 3/8” by 4½”. It is 5/8” thick. The round seal measuring 3½” in diameter has got an ornamental raised edge and is fashioned like a flower. It bears on a countersunk surface the legend Śrī-Tribhuvanāṁkuśa in the centre. Above it is a recumbent boar and over the boar is the symbol of the crescent with a dot within which may stand for the Sun. Below the legend is a floral device like a spreading lotus flower. The mass of metal at the bottom of the seal into which the ends of the ring are fixed is beaten out on either side of the ring and shaped with the face of a Yāli.</p>
<p>One of the plates was broken on the right edge and a small chip in continuation of the broken part came off by the application of pressure while taking impressions. There are small cracks seen on the top portion of the back of the last plate.</p>
<p>The plates weigh nearly 360 tolas.</p>
